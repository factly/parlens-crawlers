STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 31* TO BE ANSWERED ON 5.2.2019 REGARDING SHORTAGE OF UREA  (a) to (e):    Madam. Before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), in consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers. After assessment of requirement, DAC&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers. On the basis of month-wise & state-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and continuously monitors the availability through following system: (i) The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);(ii)\tThe State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes through their state institutional agencies like Markfed etc.(iii)\tRegular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), Department of Fertilizers (DoF), and Ministry of Railways with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments. (iv)\tThe gap between demand (requirement) and production is met through imports. The import for the season is also finalised well in advance to ensure timely availability. Thus, Department of Fertilizers ensures availability of fertilizers at the State level and the distribution to the farmers within the State is the responsibility of the respective State Government. The availability is monitored regularly at various levels and there is no shortage of any fertilizer in the country including Rajasthan. The requirement, availability and sales of Urea in Rajasthan for the peak phase of Urea as on date (31.01.2019) is indicated below in the table: <figures in LMT>Requirement, Availability and Sales of Urea in RajasthanMonth\t                     Requirement\tAvailability\tSalesNov \u201818\t                       2.55\t           2.64\t        2.61Dec\u201918\t                        2.70\t           3.67\t        3.64Jan\u2019 19 (as on 31.01.2019)\t2.40\t           2.72\t        2.58Total\t                        7.65\t           9.04\t        8.83Source:iFMSIt can be seen from the above table that availability of Urea against sales is sufficient/ adequate in Rajasthan and there is no shortage of fertilizers.********"}, {"question_number": "4730", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4730.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4730.pdf", "date": "23.03.2018", "ministry": "HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE", "members": ["Shewale Shri Rahul Ramesh", "Mahtab Shri Bhartruhari", "Jayadevan Shri C.

The scheme provides interest subvention of 2% per annum to Banks on use of their own resources.  Besides, additional 3% incentive is given to the farmers for prompt repayment of the loan, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%.  Further, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued  directions for Relief Measures to be provided by respective lending institutions in areas affected by natural calamities which, inter alia, include, restructuring/rescheduling of existing crop loans and term loans, extending fresh loans, relaxed security and margin norms, moratorium, etc. The benchmark for initiating relief measures by banks has also been reduced to 33% crop loss in line with the National Disaster Management Framework. On similar lines, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has issued Guidelines for Relief measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural Calamities to Cooperative Banks and RRBs.  Under the aforesaid interest subvention scheme, to provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, Interest Subvention of 2% is available to banks for the first year on the restructured loan amount.

(a)Introduction of GST was a historical step for transforming India into a common national market with a simplified tax regime. GST was implemented w.e.f 1st July, 2017 and was welcomed by industry and corporates. Corporate sector as represented by industry associations such as CII, FICCI, and ASSOCHAM has reacted positively to introduction of GST in India. Contd\u2026.. p.2/-       2  - (i)           The total number of companies registered during the period July, 2017 to February, 2018 (post GST) is 68,299. The number of companies registered in the corresponding period of the previous year i.e. from July, 2016 to February, 2017 was 63,106. Thus, the increasing trend in the number of companies\u2019 registrations has been maintained post GST.(ii)         The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is a lead indicator of industrial activity based on monthly production data from selected manufacturing units. The average growth rate of IIP was 5% during July, 2017-January, 2018 which was higher as compared to that of 3.9% in July, 2016-January, 2017. Industrial activity, post introduction of GST, has thus accelerated.(iii)       The data released by RBI shows that the growth in year-on-year sales for corporates in Q2 and Q3 of 2017-18 stood at 7.2% and 11.3% respectively. The corresponding figures for Q2 and Q3 of 2016-17 stood at 1.9% and 2.8% respectively. Thus, the growth in sales for corporates has also seen a remarkable increase in the post GST period so far.(iv)       Also, the overall growth rate of GDP increased from 6.5% in Q2 to 7.2% in Q3 of 2017-18. The corresponding figures for 2016-17 were 7.6% and 6.8% respectively. (b)    Introduction of GST was the biggest tax reform in independent India. Introduction of GST has reduced the multiplicity of taxes and has thus created a simpler tax regime to promote ease of doing business.

MAHESH SHARMA)(a) to (d) The cumulative accumulation of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) since the pre-industrial era, besides depletion of global sinks such as forests etc., has contributed to the problem of global warming. The atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) have all increased since 1750 due to human activity. In 2011 the concentrations of these greenhouse gases were 391 ppm, 1803 ppb, and 324 ppb, and exceeded the pre-industrial levels by about 40%, 150%, and 20%, respectively. Recognizing that climate change is a global challenge and requires concerted efforts at global level to cut down the emissions of GHGs, India is engaged constructively at global level through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement under UNFCCC to combat it. In the pre-2020 period, India announced its voluntary goal to reduce the emission intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 20-25 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020. India has achieved 12% reduction in emission intensity between 2005 and 2010 and is on course to achieve the voluntary goal by 2020. Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC economy wide mitigation goals for 2021-2030.To address the issues of climate change, Government of India is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which includes eight national missions being implemented by various Ministries in specific areas of Solar Energy, Enhanced Energy Efficiency, Sustainable Habitat, Water, Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem, Green India, Sustainable Agriculture and Strategic knowledge for Climate Change. A total of Rs. 14393.45 Crores has been allocated for these missions under NAPCC for the year 2014-15 to 2016-17. During 2015-16, Government of India launched the scheme- National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change with an initial corpus of Rs. 350 crores for remaining period of 12th Five Year Plan to support adaptation actions of States and Union Territories. The scheme has continued beyond 12th Plan period. ***"}, {"question_number": "4662", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4662.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4662.pdf", "date": "23.03.2018", "ministry": "HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE", "members": ["Ray Dr. Ravindra Kumar", "Ghubaya Shri Sher Singh"], "subject": "Financial Assistance for Construction of Hospitals", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66528&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "Will the Minister of HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE be pleased to state: (a) whether the Government has any proposal to provide financial assistance for construction of private hospitals in the rural areas to improve healthcare facilities in the country; (b) if so, the details thereof; and (c) if not, the reasons therefor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):\tThere \tis no proposal to provide financial assistance for construction of private hospitals in the rural areas under NHM.(b) & (c):     Public Health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to provide healthcare services to its people lies with the respective State/UT Governments.

Compliance of CRAs with the SEBI Regulations / circulars / guidelines is checked by the CRA\u2019s internal auditors every half \u2013 year, and also by SEBI, during its periodic inspections. Further, CRAs which are recognized and regulated by SEBI are also accredited by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for the specific purpose of rating bank loans and other bank facilities and RBI issues instructions to such accredited CRAs from time to time in respect of the same. Banks in India are presently under Standardised Approach (SA) for capital computation under Basel framework. Under this approach, banks use ratings assigned by accredited CRAs for assigning risk weights for computation of their credit risk capital for corporate exposures (fund based and non-fund based).

RBI has further apprised that gross Non-Performing Asset (NPA) ratios may not be comparable because of the differences in income recognition and asset classification norms across different jurisdictions. In addition, RBI has informed that as per IMF data on Financial Stability Indicators (FSI), 33 countries (out of countries that have submitted data) had gross NPA ratio higher than that of India. (c): Earlier, despite repayment not being regular, through flexibility in loan classification, banks continued to classify stressed accounts as non-NPA by restructuring them. An Asset Quality Review, carried out for clean and fully provisioned balance-sheets in 2015, revealed high NPAs. Through realistic recognition, the NPA amounts of PSBs rose from Rs. 2,78,466 crore in March 2015 to Rs. 7,33,137 crore in June 2017.

The Government of India has taken various initiatives to boost the growth of the economy which, inter-alia, include; fillip to manufacturing, concrete measures for transport and power sectors as well as other urban and rural infrastructure, comprehensive reforms in the foreign direct investment policy and special package for textile industry, push to infrastructure development by giving infrastructure status to affordable housing and focus on coastal connectivity. For highways development the Bharatmala Pariyojana has been launched. The government has launched a phased program for bank recapitalization. This entails infusion of capital to the public sector banks, which is expected to encourage banks to enhance lending.

As such from the Financial Year 2016-17, under Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign, the Ministry has started the disbursement of grant-in-aids directly to the District Collectors/ Commissioners   of selected 161 districts for implementation of BBBP Campaign in their District.  \t\t\tWith the direct release of funds to the districts, there was a requirement for opening a dedicated account for BBBP Scheme by the district collectors.  Opening of dedicated bank account and registration under PFMS to enable the district to receive funds was the challenging task.  With the continuous follow ups this has been achieved.  Due to this reason the release and utilization of fund were comparatively less. However, the Ministry has taken all available mean to achieve the financial target such as video conferences with States/District Administration and media campaign with an exhaustive 360-degree approach including Radio, TV campaign, Advertisements disseminated through Cinema Halls, newspaper advertisement, online digital media and community engagement through Song & Drama Division of MoI&B. With the help of mass media and programmes from Song and Drama Division and monitoring visits by Ministry\u2019s officials, the district administrations are being motivated to achieve the target and goal of the BBBP campaign and utilization of funds has increased.(d) \t& (e): The Scheme is being implemented as a Central Sector Scheme with 100% central funding and is being operationalized through concerned States/UTs in a well-coordinated and strategic manner.  However, the onus of implementation of BBBP scheme at root level is lying with District Administration under guidance from their State/UT and the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of Human Resource Development.

MAHESH SHARMA)(a)  A scientific study to assess the impact of climate change has been conducted and a report titled \u201cClimate Change and India: A 4X4 Assessment - A Sectoral and Regional Analysis for 2030s\u201d was published in 2010 by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The study assessed impact of climate change on four key sectors of Indian economy, namely, agriculture, water, forests and human health in four climate sensitive regions of India - the Himalayan region, the Western Ghats, the Coastal region and the North-Eastern region. The study projects a variable rate of change in agricultural production including losses in some crops and change in the composition of the forests and net primary productivity. Extreme precipitation events are likely to increase in all the regions. Water yield is projected to increase in the Himalayan Region, whereas it is likely to be variable across other three regions. Malaria is projected to spread to new areas and threat of its transmission is likely to increase in duration.(b) The mining activities is not the major cause for climate change and greenhouse gas emissions from mining activities are small as compared to other sectors of the Indian economy.  As per India\u2019s first Biennial Update Report submitted to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2016, GHG emissions from mining and quarrying was 4313.44 Gg CO2 eq. in the year 2010, which accounted for 0.2% of the total greenhouse gas emissions. (c) The provision for National Institute for Climate Change Studies and Actions exists in the central sector scheme- Climate Change Action Programme. However, the details are not worked out.  (d)   Some recent studies suggest an increasing frequency and intensity of extremes in rainfall during past 40-50 years. However, their attribution to global warming is not confirmed. The inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change and our country\u2019s own assessment using regional climate models project that extreme rainfall events are likely to be more frequent in India in future.(e)  To address the issues of climate change, Government of India is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which includes eight national missions, implemented by various Ministries in specific areas of Solar Energy, Enhanced Energy Efficiency, Sustainable Habitat, Water, Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem, Green India, Sustainable Agriculture and Strategic knowledge for Climate Change.  It outlines a number of steps to simultaneously advance India\u2019s development and climate change related objectives of adaptation and mitigation. State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) prepared by 28 States and 4 Union Territories (UTs) are consistent with objectives of NAPCC. ****"}, {"question_number": "4608", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4608.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4608.pdf", "date": "23.03.2018", "ministry": "HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE", "members": ["P.

The entire process of RBH scheme was facilitated by Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). Under the scheme, the Ministry extended financial support upto Rs.25 Lakhs for viable projects and the balance project cost had to be converged through other Central/State Government Schemes/Financial Institutions.Under the said scheme, the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) were encouraged to identify skills and endowments of rural people as well as natural resources in the Panchayat area. Based upon the assessment, joint awareness programs could be organized to bring together the business interest and the community on a common platform and thereby facilitate acceptance of business plan by local stakeholders. PRIs could also dovetail and converge government schemes with the initiative, or provide infrastructure support to ensure better livelihood opportunities for the rural community, better incomes and better and more sustainable use of local resources.Under the RBH, Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) were entered into by business enterprises with PRIs in accordance with the guidelines of the scheme in such  diverse fields as fruit processing, power generation and distribution, Jatropha bio-fuels, handicrafts, carpet weaving, stone carving etc. Besides, this Ministry had also a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) with EXIM Bank for the purpose of enhancing export possibilities of products sourced from RBHs. The scheme of RBH was implemented during the year 2007-2012 and therefore, no steps obviously for any purpose can be taken under the above mentioned defunct scheme. However, Under the restructured scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) appraised by Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) for implementation in the next financial year, there is component for assistance to States for project based support for economic development and income enhancement through Panchayats / cluster of Panchayats to create sustainable livelihood systems and income enhancement avenues in rural areas, and transform cluster of Gram Panchayats to become growth centers for local economy. Under this initiative, Panchayats may assume supportive role in providing marketing support for secondary agriculture, as well as minor produce including medicinal plants, bamboo, handloom, handicraft etc. Financial assistance will be limited to viable gap funding which is not available under any other scheme or requires more resources in critical areas.*****"}, {"question_number": "392", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AS392.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AS392.pdf", "date": "22.03.2018", "ministry": "DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION", "members": ["Jadhav Shri Sanjay Haribhau"], "subject": "Awareness under SBM", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66244&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a) the amount of expenditure incurred in Maharashtra for promoting social awareness under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) during the last four years;(b) whether the Government has received reports about the incidents of people being beaten up and subjected to social harassment for defecating in the open and if so, the details thereof;(c) whether steps are being taken by the Government to prevent such incidents;(d) if so, the details and the outcome thereof; and(e) if not, the reasons therefor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER FOR DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION(SUSHREE UMA BHARATI)(a) to (e)   A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.392 due for reply on 22.03.2018.(a)    A total of Rs.48.13 crore have been spent on Information, Education and Communication (IEC) in Maharashtra during last four years under Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) [SBM-G] by the Centre and State Governments.(b) SBM-G guidelines and the programme stresses upon positive behaviour change and community mobilisation to promote toilet usage and to make villages open defecation free.

As per the recommendations of the Expenditure Management Commission chaired by Dr. Bimal Jalan, Eminent Economist/Public Policy Expert, each Ministry /Department should enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)  with their Autonomous Bodies, on the same lines as done for Central Public Sector Enterprises    (CPSEs), clearly laying down the performance parameters as also the roadmap to carry out the intended course of action. As per the report, Organizations that distinctly serve \u201ca public purpose\u201d specially in sectors with significant externalities need to be strengthened further and at the same time may be encouraged to raise internal resources. Rule 229(xi) of General Financial Rules, 2017 also prescribes the requirement of signing of MoU by the Autonomous Organizations with their Administrative Ministry/Department. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has been pursuing with Prasar Bharati, since March 2017, to sign the MoU and several reminders have been issued to them. However, Prasar Bharati had not furnished the MoU as per prescribed norms. Nevertheless, the Ministry has released funds amounting to Rs.1989 crore under Grants-in-Aid Salaries to Prasar Bharati from April, 2017 to December 2017. The salaries of Prasar Bharati\u2019s employees for the months of January and February, 2018, have been paid by Prasar Bharati from their Internal Extra Budgetary Resources (IEBR).  The revised MoU received from Prasar Bharati has been considered in the Ministry and sent to them with some modifications to take further steps for signing the MoU with the Ministry.  Prasar Bharati earns nearly Rs. 1400.00 crore per year which is their IEBR. The total financial requirements of Prasar Bharati are met  by combining IEBR with  Grant-in-Aid releases from the Government. Prasar Bharati has to pay for Spectrum Charges and Satellite Charges from IEBR  but for past several years has not been making  any payment to Department of Space  and Department of Telecommunications and the dues mounted to  Rs. 1824.24 crore.(c) No Madam.

Out of these, 270 toll plazas are situated on road projects executed under PPP mode, where the respective Operation & Maintenance of toll plazas, including selection/ deployment of manpower rests with the private concessionaires. The remaining 152 toll plazas are located on public funded road projects, which are operated through Tolling contractors selected through competitive bidding. Therefore, NHAI does not sanction or deploy any manpower directly at the toll plazas. (b) to (d) On International Women\u2019s Day, NHAI vide Circular dated 22.02.2018  instructed its Regional Officers to explore the possibility of deployment of all women toll fee collection staff in day shift on at least one toll plaza near city area under their jurisdiction. As per the circular, the toll plaza was to be selected keeping in mind women safety issues. While this move is to be tried on pilot basis, the male staff shall continue to be deployed by their employer at toll plazas for collection of fee from NH users. Since this is a new initiative and introduced less than a month ago, the relevant data is not readily available.(e) NHAI has launched an ambitious project of \u201cHIGHWAY NEST (MINI)\u201d for convenience of highway users for their safe and comfortable journey by facilitating them with drinking water, tea/coffee, packaged food  and eatables on upside and downside of the National Highways at all the 372 toll plazas under operation by NHAI.

K. SINGH )(a) & (b):\tNo, Madam. The total Outage Losses due to water shortage reported by the stations in the current year, upto February, 2018, are about 3400 Million Units (MU), which is about 0.38% of total coal/lignite based generation during the period.Losses due to water shortage reported by the Thermal Stations during 2013-14 to 2016-17 are as follows:S.No.\tYear\tLosses in MU1\t2013-14\t4375.82\t2014-15\t1155.93\t2015-16\t9954\t2016-17\t9565.2Details of the Outage of Thermal Generating Plants due to water shortage for the last four years are furnished at Annexure.(c) :\t\tInformation in this regard is not maintained in Central Electricity Authority/Ministry of Power. However, it is informed that the outage of a thermal power plant due to shortage of water will cause loss of revenue in terms of variable charge as well as loss of fixed charge if the plant availability falls below the normative value.  (d) to (e) : \tAs per the Central Water Commission guidelines issued in November, 2014,  for Improving Water Use Efficiency in Irrigation, Domestic & Industrial Sectors, the National Commission for Integrated Water Resources Development (NCIWRD) estimated water utilization in power development as only 3% out of the total withdrawal/ utilization for 2010 for all types of uses.  The Government has taken following steps to encourage water conservation, water efficiency across the power sector:I.\tAsh water recirculation system- Water from ash pond is recovered and reused in the system.II.\tDry fly ash handling system & High concentration slurry disposal system (HCSD)- These ash handling techniques reduce the ash handling water requirement thereby reducing the water consumption. III.\tZero water discharge system \u2013 Treating the total waste water produced in the plant and recycling back in to the consumptive water system reduces water consumption. IV.\tOperating cooling towers at higher Cycle of Concentration (COC). This reduces the waste water generated by the plant. This waste water generated is used for low grade applications like ash handling, coal dust suppression and gardening etc. V.\tMost of inland thermal power plants use closed cycle cooling water system with Cooling Tower and high level of COC to recirculate the water in operation for reducing the water requirement.(f) :\t\tMinistry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MOEF&CC) has notified Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2015 on 7th December 2015 related to water consumption limit for existing and future thermal power plants:(i)\tAll plants with Once-Through-Cooling (OTC) shall install Cooling Tower (CT) and achieve specific water consumption upto a maximum of 3.5 m3/MWh within a period of two years from the date of publication of this notification.(ii)\tAll existing Cooling Tower based plants to reduce specific water consumption up to a maximum of 3.5m3/MWh within a period of two years from the date of publication of this notification.(iii)\tNew plants to be installed after 1st January, 2017 shall have to meet specific water consumption upto a maximum of 2.5m3/MWh and achieve zero waste water discharge.(g) :\t\tThe Tariff Policy, 2016 mandates the thermal Power Plants for use of treated sewage water from Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) of Municipality / local bodies, that are located within 50 km radius. All Thermal Power Plants have been advised to use STP water for cooling purpose, wherever possible. ***********"}, {"question_number": "4593", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4593.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4593.pdf", "date": "22.03.2018", "ministry": "CIVIL AVIATION", "members": ["Gopal Dr. K."], "subject": "Protection of Interests of Air India Employees", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66406&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a) whether the Government is exploring options of absorbing Air India employees in Public Sector Enterprises and offer of voluntary retirement package as it moves ahead with the airlines disinvestment amid stiff opposition from workers union, if so, the details thereof;(b) whether various other options are being considered by the Government to protect the interests of employees; and(c) if so, the details thereof?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Jayant Sinha)(a) to (c): The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), in its meeting held on 28.06.2017, has given in-principle approval for considering strategic disinvestment of Air India and its five subsidiaries.

As per year 2001 census, the average annual per capita availability of water in the country was 1816 m3/year, which has reduced to 1545 m3/year as per 2011 census. Further, projections for the year 2025 and 2050 are 1340 m3/year & 1140 m3/year respectively.The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation, now Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD & GR) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (  16 under Peninsular  Component  & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). Pre-Feasibility Reports (PFRs) of the all 30 links have been prepared and circulated to the concerned State Governments. After survey and investigations, FRs of 14 links under Peninsular Component and FRs of 2 links and draft FRs of 7 links (Indian portion) under Himalayan Component have been completed. The total expenditure on Inter Linking of Rivers (ILR) programme was estimated to be Rs.5.6 lakh crores (2002-03 price level) based on NWDA studies. National Council of Applied Economic Research has estimated that the cost of ILR project to be Rs.4.44 lakh crore (2003-04 price level). The exact requirement on realistic basis can be known only after the preparation of Detailed Project Reports of all the links.(b) to (d) During 2016-17, ninety nine (99) ongoing Major/Medium Irrigation Projects under Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh ha., have been prioritized in consultation with States along with their Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) works. For completion of these projects in a mission mode, funding mechanism under Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) through National Bank For Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has been approved by the Government for both Central and State share.  Funding  from LTIF has also been extended to Polavaram Project in Andhra Pradesh and North Koel Project in Jharkhand.  Different  State Govt. are also availing external assistance from institution like Work Bank, JICA, ADB etc for irrigation projects.

The overarching reason is differences in anthropometric built of people in different geographical regions across the country.  Doyens of the Indian Apparel Industry have admitted that body sizing is a major problem for domestic apparel brands. In absence of any standardised size chart for Indian sizes, the prevalent practice in apparel industry is to adapt available size charts to Indian need. The online Indian Fashion catalogue is dominated by Apparel (47%) followed by Fashion Accessories (40%), Footwear (9%) and Lingerie (4%) in 2016. There were higher percentages of Customer Initiated Returns (CIR) in apparel and lifestyle segment in comparison to other segments. This increases the cost of reverse logistics. Online clothing retailers struggle with high return rates, which is about 25% says Forrester Research a global research and advisory firm. For expensive items, returns rates are even higher than 50%. Typically, 5%-35% of products get returned to the seller through marketplaces. (c) to (e):\tNational Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), New Delhi has been sanctioned an extensive anthropometric research study to develop a body size chart for Indian population. The project is likely to be completed by the year 2021. The survey will result in the creation of Size identification number for a customer through mapping, categorization and defining of their body size. This will help manufacturer to produce goods suited for the body size of the target consumer and help consumer to identify size which will be best suited for them resulting in a match and hence sales. (f) & (g):\tIndustry has represented that imports of apparel from Bangladesh have increased as Basic Custom Duty (BCD) is exempt and post GST, there is no Countervailing Duty (CVD) or Education Cess. Industry has pointed out that there is need to have Fabric Forward Rules with neighboring countries that have Foreign Trade Agreements (FTAs) with India. Government is trying to deepen engagements with countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka by leveraging India\u2019s capacities in the value chain and linking export of apparel by these countries with the requirement to source fabrics and raw materials from India. Government has taken various steps to boost the Indian textile industry. Products such as fibre, yarn and fabric in the textile value chain are being strengthened and made competitive through various schemes, inter alia, Powertex for fabric segment, Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Schemes (ATUFS) for all segments except spinning, Scheme for Integrated Textile Park (SITP) for all segments, etc. in the silk sector, the Indigenous Automatic Reeling Machines and \u201cBuniyad Reeling Machines\u201d have been introduced to increase quality and productivity. In order to reap the benefits of demographic dividend, the Government has skilled 7.54 lakhs persons in 3 years under the Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS). Since the apparel sector has the greatest potential for employment growth, Government has introduced the Pradhan Mantri Paridhan Rozgar Portsahan Yojana (PMPRPY) Scheme under the Special Package for Apparel and Made-ups under which Government bears the entire 12% of the employers\u2019 contribution of the Employers Provident Fund Scheme for new employees of garment and made-ups sectors for first 3 years of their employment as a special incentive. *****"}, {"question_number": "4583", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4583.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4583.pdf", "date": "22.03.2018", "ministry": "POWER", "members": ["Yadav Shri Dharmendra", "Barne,Shri Shrirang Appa", "Patil Shri Shivaji Adhalrao", "Munde Dr.Pritam Gopinath"], "subject": "Power for All Scheme", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66302&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a) \twhether the Union Governments\u2019 \u201cPower for All\u201d scheme promises continuous and uninterrupted power to all households and industries by March 2019; (b) \tif so, the details thereof and the extent to which it has been achieved so far; (c) \twhether the country is about to face substantial increase in energy demand in the next few years, which will translate into higher demand for electricity, if so, the facts thereof; (d) \tthe extent to which the country\u2019s power sector is capable to meet the increased demand for electricity and the manner in which the shortfall is likely to be met; and (e) \twhether the power sector in the country has undergone a plethora of reforms in the recent past, if so, the details thereof and the outcome achieved through these reforms?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY ( SHRI  R.

Almost all the remaining eligible habitations will be sanctioned by March, 2018. The time period for completion of road works is twelve months in Plain areas and eighteen months in hilly/tribal areas. This way States would have adequate time for completion of PMGSY-I by March 2019. There is a provision of a robust 3-tier quality control mechanism under the programme. In the first tier, the PIU ensures the quality of work by way of conducting mandatory field tests for ensuring the quality of material used and the workmanship. Under 2nd tier, independent quality checks for minimum three times up-to completion, are performed by State Quality Monitors (SQMs) deployed by the respective States.

K. SINGH )(a) : \t\tAs per the information available with Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the All India Weighted Average Rate of Sale of Power (WARSP) for the year 2015-16 from hydro, thermal and nuclear sources are given at Annex.Power from Renewable Energy sources is mainly procured through Competitive Bidding. The prices discovered through competitive bidding have come down substantially during past few years. The lowest power tariff recently discovered for solar was Rs. 2.44/kWh at Bhadla solar park and lowest tariff for wind at recent auction conducted in the month of Oct 2017 was Rs. 2.64/kWh. The price of electricity in different countries from various sources of energy largely depends on their Generation mix, availability of energy resources and their internal market structure. The data regarding per unit cost of electricity from various sources of energy in the world is not available.(b) :  \t\tAs per the information received from Department of atomic Energy, at present, there are 449 reactors in operations and 56 reactors are under construction in the world across 16 countries. Of these, UAE, Belarus and Bangladesh are the new entrants in nuclear power.(c) :  \t\tIndia is recognised as a country with advanced nuclear technologies. It has a robust indigenous nuclear power programme and plans for expansion based on both indigenous technologies and with foreign cooperation. India also has a domestic nuclear industrial base. India is, therefore, a desirable destination for Global nuclear suppliers, as cooperation with Indian nuclear industry would be mutually beneficial.*****************"}, {"question_number": "4483", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4483.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4483.pdf", "date": "22.03.2018", "ministry": "SHIPPING", "members": ["Venugopal Shri K.

An Adarsh Gram evolves out of people\u2019s shared vision, using their capacities and available resources to the best extent possible which are also context specific. Hon\u2019ble Members of Parliament have identified 1,308 Gram Panchayats across India under SaansadAdarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) till 20 March 2018. The Gram Panchayats adopted under SAGY through a participatory process under the guidance of Hon\u2019ble Members of Parliament prepare Village Development Plans (VDP) containing prioritised time-bound activities to achieve holistic progress of the village. So far 942 Gram Panchayats have uploaded their Village Development Plans (VDP) on the SAGY web-site (http://saanjhi.gov.in/) containing 50,380 projects. Out of these, implementation of 21,001 (42%) projects have been completed as on 20 March 2018. As per the Panchayat Darpan data uploaded by 690 Gram Panchayats on the SaansadAdarsh Gram Yojana portal, remarkable achievements have taken place in many SAGY GPs: 427 Gram Panchayats under SAGY have achieved 100% of Children Immunization (0-6 age group), 252 Gram Panchayats have reported 100% Institutional delivery, 526 Gram Panchayats have 100% of Days Mid Day Meal (MDM) coverage to schools. Similarly 171 Gram Panchayats reported electricity connection to all Households and 91 Gram Panchayats have safe and secure Housing facility to all Households in the SAGY villages. Likewise, 160 Gram Panchayats have now e-Panchayat Service available at Gram Panchayats Office. Many Gram Panchayats have also made efforts in the area of ensuring social and financial security in their respective Gram Panchayats by enrolling every eligible individual to Government programmes like Jan DhanYojana (174 GPs), Atal Pension Yojana (58 GPs), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana (85 GPs), RashtriyaSwasthyaBimaYojna (70 GPs), Widow Pension (332 GPs), Old Age Pension (323 GPs). The Ministry, inter-alia, has taken following initiatives for better implementation of the scheme:o\tAs many as 22 central schemes have amended their guidelines or enabled priority for the SAGY Gram Panchayats. A compilation of 223 Central Sector/ Centrally Sponsored and 1,806 State Schemes for convergence under SAGY for the benefit of Members of Parliament, District and Village level officials has been prepared. Ministry has also published a document named \u2018SAHYOG\u2019 as an indicative guidance document with the essential information on the existing social security schemes collated from respective Ministries to enrich the knowledge of villagers and village level functionaries to achieve 100% enrollment into the social/ financial Security Schemes in SAGY Gram Panchayats.o\tDeveloped a 35 point outcome indicator covering basic amenities, education, health, sanitation, livelihood, women empowerment, financial inclusion, food security, social security and e-governance to gauge the impact of SAGY in the Gram Panchayats.o\tCoordinated with other Central Ministries/ Departments for ensuring provision of four key basic services viz. power, drinking water, roads and education in all SAGY Gram Panchayats.o\tThe Ministry has circulated suggestive template to state governments for preparing proposals for tapping support from Private, Voluntary and Cooperative (PVC) sectors. The proposals received from States/UTs have been displayed on the SAGY website for wider circulation.

Under Article 243G of the Constitution, State Legislatures are to endow to the Panchayats with powers and authority to enable them to function as institutions of local self-government and plan and implement schemes for economic development and social justice including on matters listed in the Eleventh Schedule.  States vary in the extent to which they have devolved powers to Panchayats.  Within the above framework and respective schematic guidelines, the Panchayats are actively involved in implementation of various Central Schemes / Programmes such as Capacity Building-Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (CB-PSA), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G), National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) etc.     Two schemes namely Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA) and District Component of Backward Region Grant Fund (BRGF) were being implemented by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj till 2014-15.  The State Component of RGPSA and the District Component of BRGF were delinked from budgetary support of Central Government w.e.f. 2015-16.  Under the scheme of Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA) implemented during the year 2012-13 to 2015-16 and Capacity Building-Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (CB-PSA) during 2016-17 & 2017-18, funds were provided to States for strengthening of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) across the country. The details of funds sanctioned, released and utilized by States during last three years and current year are given in Annexure-I. States are required to fulfil certain essential conditions for availing funds. The criteria inter-alia include the following:-\u2022\tRegular elections to Panchayats or local bodies in non-part-IX areas under the superintendence and control of the State Election Commission. \u2022\tAt least one third reservation for women in Panchayats or other local bodies. \u2022\tConstitution of State Finance Commission (SFC) every five years and placement of Action Taken Report on the recommendations of the SFC in the State legislature. \u2022\tConstitution of District Planning Committees in all districts, and issuing of guidelines/rules to make them functional. The funds are released to States on basis of the Annual Plans, received from States, as approved by Central Executive Committee (CEC) and as per guidelines of the scheme of RGPSA/ CB-PSA after adjusting unspent balance of previous year.  Funds under BRGF were utilized by the States to bridge critical gaps in local infrastructure and other development requirements that were not being adequately met through existing inflows. A statement showing funds allocated, released to States by MoPR and utilization reported by them during the financial year 2014-15 (Programme delinked w.e.f. financial year 2015-16) is given at Annexure-II.           The Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), inter alia, is implementing rural development schemes, namely, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Pradhan Mantri  Aawas Yojana-Garmin(PMAY-G), Pradhan Manti Gram Sadak Yojana(PMGSY), Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojna \u2013 National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalaya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) through State Governments and Union Territory Administrations.  The objective of these programmes is to bring about overall improvement in the quality of life in rural areas through employment generation, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, ensuring minimum national standard for social assistance and provision of other basic amenities.  PRIs have been entrusted central role in the implementation and monitoring of rural development schemes.  As per MGNREGA Act, the Gram Panchayats are responsible for identification of work to be taken up as per the recommendation of Gram Sabha and in terms of cost at least 50% of the total work shall be executed by the Gram Panchayats.  Under PMAY-G, beneficiaries are identified through Gram Sabha based on the Socio Economic Caste Census, 2011 data.  Further under NSAP, Gram Panchayats have been given the central role for identification of new beneficiaries. For centrally sponsored schemes of MoRD, funds are transferred to the State Governments and UTs or transferred directly to the beneficiary\u2019s bank account under Direct Benefit Transfer.  Under the RGPSA/ CB-PSA scheme, the States are supposed to utilise the funds as per guidelines and in line with the specific observations of Central Empowered Committee (CEC) if any, while approving the respective proposals. The states have been repeatedly requested for furnishing their audited report, statement of account and utilization certificate in respect of financial assistance provided to them for strengthening the Panchayats at all levels. The progress of utilization of funds reviewed regularly through meetings, field visits of senior officers and video conference. Under BRGF Programme, all States have been advised to submit complete Utilization Certificates (UCs) or refund the unspent balance, if any, to this Ministry. (e)\tUnder the RGPSA/ CB-PSA scheme, no case has been reported so far from any State regarding mismanagement/ irregularities/ diversion of funds. (f)\tUnion Government has proposed enhancement of total budget allocation to Rs 720.80 crore for 2018-19 under Capacity Building \u2013 Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (CB/PSA).  The scheme of CB-PSA is a demand driven scheme which primarily aims at strengthening the Panchayati Raj Institutions across the Country. No financial target for any State under the scheme is fixed since the scheme provides for funding activities selected by States/ UTs as reflected in their respective Perspective Plan and Annual Plan subject to the approval of CEC of the scheme. The funds are released to States on the basis of the Annual Plans of States approved by CEC as per guidelines of the scheme out of annual budgetary provision made for the scheme for the respective year.*****"}, {"question_number": "4459", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4459.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4459.pdf", "date": "22.03.2018", "ministry": "WATER RESOURCES, RIVER DEVELOPMENT AND GANAGA REJUVENATION", "members": ["Rajbhar Shri Hari Narayan"], "subject": "Closure of Industrial Units Polluting Ganga River", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66307&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a) whether the Government is aware that Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has failed to check the industrial units which are polluting the Ganga river; (b) if so, the State-wise details thereof including Uttar Pradesh and the reasons therefor; (c) whether the Government is going to close down those units that are polluting the river most and if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor; and (d) the measures being taken by the Government to make the river pollution free so that it can remain a life line for the people besides holding religious belief for them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR WATER RESOURCES, RIVER DEVELOPMENT AND GANGA REJUVENATION & HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT(DR.

One of the link namely Manas-Sankosh-Teesta-Ganga (MSTG) link under the Himalayan Component of NPP envisages diversion of the surplus waters of Manas and Sankosh rivers with supplementation from the intermediate major streams namely Aie, Raidak, Torsa and Jaldhaka for the benefit of augmenting the flows of Ganga at Farakka and further transfer to water scarce areas of Krishna, Pennar and Cauvery basins and providing irrigation facilities to the enroute command areas including the Teesta basin for meeting the requirements of North Bengal. No transfer of water from Teesta river is envisaged.  Pre-Feasibility Report of this link has been prepared by NWDA. (c)\tThe contribution of the glaciers to the river flow depends upon the size and properties of the glacier and temperature. Most of the contribution due to glacier is received in the downstream areas during the months when temperature remains high, e.g. April to June in north India. In case the contribution of glacier reduces in lean season due to any reason, the livelihood of mountain communities and lower riparian communities dependent on these sources would be adversely affected. Central Water Commission (CWC) carries out hydrological observation on important rivers round the year including Teesta Basin. CWC has observed the river flow in Teesta Basin at Bansoi, Lachung and Sankalang HO site. Snow melt and glaciers melt is cyclic process which rejuvenate the river in non-monsoon season.

Under the scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) /Capacity Building- Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (CB-PSA)/ erstwhile Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA), Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) provides financial assistance to States/ UTs for capacity building including infrastructure and e-enablement including computers and peripherals, to Gram Panchayats. However, in the context of devolution of funds under Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) award, the support for procurement of computers, construction of building etc. to States has been discontinued w.e.f. 2015-16.  The State/ UT-wise details of funds sanctioned for e-enablement during the last three years and current year are given in Annexure.  Further, some amount from the FFC grant can also be utilised by the Gram Panchayats for procurement of computers.  MoPR is also implementing e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP) that seeks to transform the functioning of all the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) by making them more transparent, accountable and effective as organs of decentralized self-governing institutions. Under e-Panchayat MMP, a suite of Core Common Applications has been developed to address various aspects of Panchayats\u2019 functioning including planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring, social audit and delivery of citizen services like issue of certificates, licences etc. Together these applications constitute the Panchayat Enterprise Suite (PES).  The aim of the MMP is to automate the internal functioning and e-enable the service delivery across all nearly 2.5 lakh Panchayats. The level of adoption of various PES Applications at panchayat level varies across States / UTs due to differentials in the preparedness of panchayats for e-enablement. Besides, some States have also developed their own State-specific applications for similar purposes. Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Government of India, is implementing the BharatNet project to provide broadband connectivity to all GPs of the country.  Phase-I of the project to connect one lakh GPs has been completed in December, 2017.  As on 4th March, 2018, about 1,13,226 GPs in the country have been connected by Optical Fibre and 1,03,730 GPs have been made service ready. All the GPs in the country are targeted to be connected by March, 2019 in phase II of the project.Further, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India,  initiated a project namely, \u201cCommon Services Centre (CSC) 2.0\u201d in August, 2015 under Digital India Programme for a period of four years, which aimed to set up at least one CSC at GP level to cover all 2.5 lakh GPs across the country. The key objective of CSCs is to deliver various citizen centric services, such as, Government to Citizen (G2C), Business to Citizen (B2C) services, financial inclusion services, educational services, skill development services etc. Till February, 2018, there are 2,92,481 CSCs functioning across the country; among which, 1,83,184 CSCs are at GP level.(d) \tBased on the feedback received from States, the PES applications are continuously updated to meet the various State-specific requirements. Furthermore, with changing technologies, the software applications are also continuously upgraded by National Informatics Center (NIC).  Also, under BharatNet it is now targeted to connect all the GPs in the country through Optical Fibre Cable by using an optical mix of underground fibre, aerial fibre, radio and satellite media."}, {"question_number": "4409", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4409.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4409.pdf", "date": "22.03.2018", "ministry": "CIVIL AVIATION", "members": ["Choudhary Col.

The Bill envisages to constitute a standalone Tribunal with permanent establishment and permanent office space and infrastructure so as to obviate the need to set up a separate Tribunal for each water dispute which is invariably time-consuming process. The proposed amendments in the Bill will speed up the adjudication of water disputes referred to it. The Bill was referred to Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water Resources for examination, which submitted its recommendation on the Bill vide Lok Sabha Secretariat letter dated 11.08.2017 in the form of \u2018Nineteenth Report of Standing Committee on Water Resources on the Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 2017\u2019. Accordingly, the Ministry has prepared draft Cabinet Note for Official Amendments to Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 2017.(c) & (d)\t  The Central Government has constituted Mahanadi Water Disputes Tribunal vide Notification No. S.O. 1114(E) dated 12.03.2018 for adjudication of water disputes between the concerned States on Mahanadi river.Contd\u2026P/2//2//Further, the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) submitted its reports and decision under Section 5(2) of the ISRWD Act, 1956 to the Central Government on 05.02.2007 which was published in the Official Gazette on 19.2.2013 to make it effective and binding on party States. CWDT determined the yield of Cauvery basin at Lower Coleroon Anicut as 740 TMC at 50 % dependability. It allocated 419 TMC to Tamil Nadu, 270 TMC to Karnataka, 30 TMC to Kerala and 7 TMC to Puducherry. It also allowed 10 TMC for environmental purpose and 4 TMC as inevitable escapage to the sea. It also directed the Karnataka to make available 192 TMC at inter-State contact point Billigundulu by specifying monthly schedule.The party States filed Civil Appeals against the order of CWDT dated 5.2.2007 before the Supreme Court. In this regard, the Supreme Court has pronounced its final verdict 16.02.2018 wherein share of Karnataka has been increased to 284.75 TMC and the share of Tamil Nadu has been reduced to 404.25 TMC.  Consequently, Karnataka has now to make available 177.25 TMC at Billigundulu.

In our engagements, we have emphasized that this has been a mutually-beneficial partnership which should be nurtured. Indian skilled professionals have contributed to the growth and development of the US economy and have helped the US retain its competitive edge and innovation advantage. They are a big stakeholder in India-US relations and their backward linkages to India have helped US businesses.On December 18, 2015, the US President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 114-113) which increased the supplemental visa fee for L-1 and H-1B visas for a period of 10 years for companies employing 50 or more employees in the United States, 50% or more of which were on L-1 and H-1B visas (50:50 rule). With this legislation in place, 50:50 companies are required to pay an enhanced fee of $4,500 for each L-1 visa and $4,000 for each H-1B visa as compared to $2,250 and $2,000 previously.Issues relating to H-1B and L-1 visa programmes, including the increase in visa fee, were discussed in the meeting of the India-US CEO Forum, held in New Delhi on August 2016. The participants inter alia emphasised the need to ensure that the visa programmes do not include discriminatory provisions that distinguish based upon business model or country of origin.The matter on US visa fee hike has been raised by India at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Geneva. India held consultations with the United States on 11-12 May 2016 at the WTO, Geneva under the dispute settlement procedures of the World Trade Organisation on the basis that the increased fees appear to result in treatment that is less favourable to Indian firms and consequently violate provisions of the General Agreement on Trade in Services.*****"}, {"question_number": "376", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AS376.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AS376.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "DEFENCE", "members": ["Reddy Shri A.P.

(a) to (d)\tThere are proposals under consideration in the U.S. to reform the H-1B visa programmes. However, so far, no comprehensive changes have been made.  In the current (115th) Congress, seven Bills relating to H-1B Visa programmes have been introduced by individual Congressmen and Senators. However, so far, none of these Bills have been passed. On the Executive side, on April 18, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) titled \"Buy American and Hire American\u201d, which requires different arms of the U.S. Administration to suggest reforms to the H-1B visa programme. This process is still underway. The US Administration has also taken some steps towards stricter enforcement and prevention of abuse of the work visa programmes.Most recently, on 22 February 2018, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services published a policy memorandum titled, \u201cContracts and Itineraries Requirements for H-1B Petitions Involving Third-Party Worksites\u201d. This policy memorandum establishes the burden on the petitioner to demonstrate that the beneficiary is employed for a specific assignment in a specialty occupation under an employer-employee relationship in a third-party worksite. The memorandum does not specifically target Indian companies but applies to all companies that engage in third-party placements. Government of India is in close consultation with all stakeholders including NASSCOM in this matter. Government of India remains closely engaged with the U.S. Administration and the Congress on all issues relating to movement of Indian professionals including under the H-1B visa programme. In our engagements, we have emphasized that this has been a mutually-beneficial partnership which should be nurtured. Indian skilled professional have contributed to the growth and development of the U.S. economy and have helped the U.S. retain its competitive edge and innovation advantage.

The IWFA mentions that EDF and NPCIL shall comply with the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act 2010 and CLND Rules, 2011.(d)\tThere have been sporadic protests by a section of the locals against setting up of the nuclear power plant at Jaitapur. Groups ideologically opposed to nuclear power have also protested against the setting up of the plant.The protests have mainly been on account of issues related to Rehabilitation and apprehensions about loss of traditional means of livelihood & safety of the plant.   (e)\tNo, Sir.  A structured ongoing public outreach programme based on a multipronged approach is implemented to address the apprehensions of the people about safety of nuclear power and related issues and allay their fears in a credible manner. Several studies by expert agencies have concluded that the project will not adversely affect the agriculture, horticulture, fishing and other traditional means of livelihood pursued by the local people. The issues related to rehabilitation are being addressed in association with the State Government. In this regard, in addition to compensation for land awarded, an ex gratia of Rs.211.05 crore at Rs.22.5 lakh per hectare was also implemented.

It is estimated to reach USD 167 Billion in the current FY 2017-18.  The export of software and services is estimated to reach USD 126 Billion in the current FY.  It is the largest export sector for the country comprising 24% of total exports.  Further, the software and services exports are projected to grow at 7% to 9 % and reach nearly USD 135 \u2013 137 Billion in the FY 2018-19.India\u2019s Digital Economy has received a tremendous boost through various Government Initiatives such as Digital India covering e-Government Services, Common Service Centres, BPO Promotion Schemes, Digital Payments, Electronic Manufacturing, and Digital Saksharta Abhiyaan; e-Commerce, GST Network, Make in India, Start-up India, e-Health, Smart Cities, and e-Agriculture Market Place/ Digital Mandis. These initiatives coupled with new and emerging technologies are enhancing the digital economy of the country and are creating IT and Electronics led new job opportunities in both traditional as well as new sectors of the economy such as Transport, Health, Power, Agriculture, and Tourism.  (c) and (d): Estimation of expected reduction in jobs is conjectural at this stage as various legislative changes proposed are at discussion stage and not yet become law.  Government of India remains closely engaged with the U.S. Administration and the Congress on all issues relating to movement of Indian professionals including under the H-1B visa programme. In our engagements, we have emphasized that this has been a mutually beneficial partnership which should be nurtured. Indian skilled professionals have contributed to the growth and development of the U.S. economy and have helped the U.S. retain its competitive edge and innovation advantage. As regards the employment in IT sector, the number of employees has nearly become 39,68,000 in CFY 2017-18, an addition of 1,05,000, from 38,63,000 in FY 2016-17.  The hiring trend is projected to remain similar to CFY in the FY 2018-19 and technology jobs in related sectors are expected to grow faster with continuous focus on re-skilling.  According to NASSCOM, it is estimated that the IT-BPM sector would continue to hire at a rate of 3% to 3.5% year-on-year to reach 45,00,000 total jobs by 2022.The Government initiatives such as Common Service Centres (CSCs), BPO Promotion schemes, Electronic Manufacturing, Digital Payments, and Digital Saksharta Abhiyaan have generated nearly 15 lakh additional jobs over the last two years.  This includes about 5 lakh jobs generated by the growth in the Electronic Manufacturing Sector.  India is becoming a promising centre of mobile manufacturing.  In 2014, there were only 2 factories; since this Government has come to power, now 118 factories are manufacturing mobiles and accessories,  including some of the best global brands.Another programme of BPO in small towns of this Government with due incentives is also finding great support.  Many BPOs have started operating in small towns in North East, J&K, UP, Bihar, Maharashtra and Southern States.  This is creating good employment locally for young people including women.*******"}, {"question_number": "4370", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4370.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4370.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "ATOMIC ENERGY", "members": ["Tadas Shri Ramdas Chandrabhanji", "Joshi Shri Chandra Prakash"], "subject": "Delay in Execution of KNPP", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=65973&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a)   whether there was huge cost escalation due to delay in the execution and commissioning of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KNPP);(b)   if so, the details thereof and the reasons therefor; and(c)   the steps taken by the Government to rectify the deficiencies noticed in execution of the said projects?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER\u2019S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)&(b)   The original approved completion cost of Kudankulam project Units 1&2 (KKNPP 1&2 \u2013 2X1000 MW) was Rs.13171 crore. The project has been completed and the units are in commercial operation. The completion cost is to be Rs.22462 crore. The increase in cost has been mainly on account of additional scope of work, escalation, Interest During Construction (IDC) and foreign exchange variation. The delay in the completion of Kudankulam Units \u2013 1&2 (2X1000 MW) were mainly due to delays in sequential receipts of equipment from Russian Federation and subsequent local protests at the site. The domino effect of the protests, demobilization & subsequent remobilization of resources, various litigations, meeting the directives of the Honorable Supreme Court by various agencies before commissioning of the plant took time. In addition, being the first-of-a-kind reactor in India of large unit size and with many imported equipment/components, the reviews and regulatory clearances also took time. (c)\tPresently, KKNPP-1&2 (2X1000 MW) are in commercial operation. They have cumulatively generated about 24335 Million Units of electricity as on February, 2018.

Also, a structured ongoing public outreach programme based on a multipronged approach is implemented to address the apprehensions of the people about safety of nuclear power and related issues and allay their concerns in a credible manner.******"}, {"question_number": "4369", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4369.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4369.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY", "members": ["Dubey Shri Nishikant ", "Pandey Shri Rajesh"], "subject": "Shortage of Skilled Manpower", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66147&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "Will the Minister of ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY be pleased to state:(a) whether there is considerable shortage of skilled manpower in the Information Technology (IT) sector;(b) if so, the details thereof and the steps taken by the Government in this regard;(c) whether the Government has made any assessment and planning for immediate requirement of manpower in the IT sector due to Digital India Programme and online transactions and advent of more software related programmes; and(d) if so, the details thereof and the skill development training proposed to be given to the educated youth in the country?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        (a) to (d):  As per NASSCOM, Indian Information Technology - Business Process Management (IT-BPM) Industry continued to be a net hirer with an addition of 1,70,000 new jobs with a total employee base of around 3.9 million in the Year 2016-17. However, speedy adoption of automation and emerging technologies are affecting some jobs and new jobs which are being created require newer skill-sets. The Government of India and Indian IT-BPM Industry are increasingly looking at new skill-sets and subject matter experts to continue on the evolution growth path. New job roles in the areas such as Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, Data Science, Mobile App development, etc are evolving, which is giving rise to a new breed of domain experts. It is also indicated that with changing paradigms of talent deployment, re-skilling of employees is becoming the key agenda for IT Industry. Various initiatives of Government of India such as Digital India covering e-Government Services, Common Service Centres, BPO Promotion Schemes, Digital Payments, Electronic Manufacturing, and Digital Saksharta Abhiyaan; e-Commerce, GST Network, Make in India, Start-up India, e-Health, Smart Cities, and e-Agriculture Market Place/ Digital Mandis, etc are creating new job opportunities.

NASSCOM also indicates that many firms have already established dedicated programs to re-skill their existing employees. Government of India has setup various Sector Skill Councils (SSC) including NASSCOM IT-ITeS SSC to address the requirement of present and future skills and job roles by covering developing job standards, training content, Faculty & student training, Assessments and certification, etc.Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NASSCOM, to collaborate and strengthen their cooperation in the field of skill development particularly with respect to the re-skilling and up-skilling imperative in areas of new and emerging technologies, with Government acting as an enabler/facilitator. A future skills platform for Business to Business (B2B) skilling (http://futureskills.nasscom.in/) has been launched by NASSCOM. In addition, MeitY takes up several capacity building activities to ensure availability of trained human resources for the manufacturing & service sectors of Electronics and IT industry.

The guide lines issued by National Disaster Management Authority are being followed.  National Disaster Management Plan-2016 (NDMP-2016) issued by NDMA provides guidelines for Capacity Development in the area of Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies. NDMP-2016 stipulates establishment of tertiary care hospitals for treatment of radiation injuries and establishment of primary and secondary care hospitals of adequate capacity at selected cities.(c)   No please. Major sea ports in the country are equipped with radiation detection equipment\u2019s (RDEs) for scanning presence of any radioactive material containers.  Further  India has set up at  the  national  level  an  institutional  mechanism  called  a       Counter Nuclear Smuggling Team (CNST) to devise a coordinated multi-agency approach to deal with the threat of individuals or group of individuals acquiring nuclear or radioactive material for malicious purposes. (d)   The International Panel on Fissile Materials in their research report titled \u201cFast Breeder Reactor Programs: History and Status\u201d released in Feb 2010 mentions various incidents of sodium leaks in international liquid sodium cooled fast breeder reactors (Russia, France, Japan, United Kingdom, India) based on data available in published literature. In all the cases, the resulting sodium fire was extinguished by plant operators using the sodium fire-extinguishing systems provided and these incidents did not affect reactor safety. In fast breeder reactors, diverse leak detection systems are provided (two different methods) for all sodium pipelines and equipment. Emphasis is placed on early detection of sodium leaks by providing sensitive instrumentation to detect and alert the operator for taking necessary safety action. Dry-chemical powder / inerting with inert gas is used to extinguish sodium fire. (e)   Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) has developed Handheld 12-Channel Tele-ECG, which is a portable, light weight Mobile Controlled ECG machine and capable of simultaneous acquiring all 12 channels of ECG in Real time. The machine can be connected to Mobile/PC via Bluetooth and the report is generated in the form of an image that can be sent to the expert via MMS or internet. This has provided virtual instantaneous ECG diagnostic service to a villager at his home/village thus, proving the philosophy \u2013 \u201cCardiac Care \u2013 Just a Click Away\u201d. This saves crucial time, which is otherwise lost in transporting the patient to the nearest cardiac care center.(f)   Department of Atomic Energy and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in particular has significantly contributed for application of atomic energy for several societal applications.

Indian Railways has been able to cater to the existing demands of transport.  (c) & (d) Till 2013-14, scarcity of funds was one of the important factors that had affected execution of railway projects as Railway projects are highly capital intensive and have long gestation period. The funds for the Railway projects are allocated project-wise on yearly basis and is done as per availability of resources and progress of the project. However, the scarcity of funds has never affected the survey work. Since 2014-15, the following steps have been taken to improve the funding scenario of Railway projects: (1) Institutional financing by tying up loan for ?1.5 lac crore for assured funding of viable projects has increased Railway\u2019s capacity for committed fund provision for capacity enhancement \tprojects.

Environmental Survey Laboratories (ESLs) of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), a constituent unit of the Department of Atomic Energy established at all Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) carries out periodic survey of radioactivity levels in environment and estimate the dose to members of public residing around NPPs.  The doses received are small percentages of the limit prescribed by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB).  As opined by International bodies such as the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), the populations living near NPPs receiving miniscule doses are not likely to be vulnerable to radiation induced diseases.  \tEpiodemiological survey for health assessment in respect of employees working in close proximity of radiation and staying in the nearby residential complex and villages of each of the nuclear power plants in operation have been carried out by reputed local medical colleges and analysis has been carried out by Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Mumbai, a premier cancer research centre in the country.  In addition, annual medical checkups are carried out for all occupational workers regularly. (b)\tDoes not arise in view of (a) above.(c)\tExtensive surveys are carried out by Environmental Survey Laboratories (ESL) of Health, Safety and Environment Group, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) around the nuclear power plant (NPP) sites as per the requirements prescribed by Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). These surveys cover all the environmental matrices (air, water, dietary products etc.) to assess the impact of nuclear reactors on climate and environment. It is seen that the average effective dose due to operation of NPPs at the plant boundary is a very small fraction (<1%) of limits prescribed by AERB. *****"}, {"question_number": "4341", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4341.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4341.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "DEFENCE", "members": ["Chavda Shri Vinod"], "subject": "Shortage of Soldiers", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66119&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a)\twhether the Government has any data of the shortage of soldiers in all the three wings of the Armed Forces; and(b) \tif so, the details thereof?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF STATE           \t\t(DR.

At present, railway pass holders do not have the facility to book tickets online through any portal because the system of issuing railway passes is yet to be computerised.(b) With regard to ticket issued through computerised Passenger Reservation System(PRS) counters, the cost is incurred on various inputs such as premises, equipment, their maintenance, manpower cost and other costs such as electricity, furniture, stationery, networking etc., which varies from location to location.  As far as cost of issuing e-tickets is concerned, it is incurred on procurement and maintenance of hardware and software, cost of technical manpower, recurring expenditure like rent, electricity charges, internet bandwidth charges, administrative cost, etc.  As such, it is not feasible to quantify the overall cost incurred on each ticket purchased through counter and through online mode.(c) At present there is no such proposal.(d) Six sets of First Class \u2018A\u2019 privilege passes in a year are given to Gazetted Railway officers. First Class or Second Class \u2018A\u2019 or Sleeper Class privilege passes are given to non-gazetted railway employees as per entitlement and the number of sets in a year  is one (01) set of privilege pass upto the end of 5th year of railway service and thereafter three (3) sets.

This Model Act has been prepared to facilitate the States for enactment of their own land leasing laws. (b) & (c) Government of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have modified their leasing laws to promote land leasing. Madhya Pradesh Assembly has passed bill (BHUMISWAMI EVAM BATAIDAR KE HITON KA SANRAKSHAN VIDHEYAK, 2016) on 29th July, 2016 for agricultural land leasing. Some other States have reportedly initiated process to enact their own land leasing Acts based on NITI Aayog\u2019s Model Act. The enactment of land leasing laws by the States may enhance the agricultural productivity; encourage the land owners to lease out land without any fear of losing land right; and enable the tenant farmers to access bank credit, insurance, disaster relief and other support services. This may also help in occupational mobility of the rural poor and provide opportunity for occupational diversification to land owners to opt for non-farm employment. \t    -----"}, {"question_number": "4329", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4329.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4329.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "LAW AND JUSTICE", "members": ["Reddy Shri Ch.

Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi across the country.  The number of beneficiaries of these scholarship schemes during the last three years and current year is at Annexure.(b): No, Madam.

This has also enabled the actual and needy beneficiaries from the weaker sections of minorities to avail these scholarships. Besides this, the Ministry has also taken various initiatives to give wide publicity of these schemes through print advertisements and broadcast/telecast of audio/video spots through All India Radio (AIR), Doordarshan/Private TV Channels, FM Channels, Digital Cinema and various other means of outdoor publicity, including publicity made through \u2018Progress Panchayat\u2019 to make the target group aware of these schemes.

HARSH VARDHAN)(a)\tYes, Madam. (b)\tThe Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has been playing important role in providing the necessary S&T knowledgebase needed for the social and economic development of the country including that of rural areas and small cities. CSIR has always endeavored to deploy its relevant knowledge base/ technologies on the ground for benefit of common man. CSIR operated project activities under \u2018CSIR-800\u2019 program aiming at bringing in desired S&T interventions for improving quality of life of rural/common people at base of the economic pyramid. CSIR has steadily contributed its technologies/ advisory services encompassing end-to-end solutions in various domains like: food and food processing; building and construction; pottery; enhancing potability of water; energy efficiency; cultivation and processing of economic plants; affordable health etc.The achievements and accomplishments of the key \u2018CSIR-800\u2019 initiatives carried out during last two years is enclosed at Annexure-I. Further, highlights of the activities carried out in recent past are as follows: A food processing unit set up at CSIR-Centre for High Altitude Biology (CSIR-CeHAB) in the remote tribal region of Lahaul and Spiti is benefitting local common farmers, enabling making of novel products from buckwheat; and for brining of peas (a major crop). CSIR developed an automated processing unit for sugar cane juice bottling, which is being popularized. CSIR is empowering the selected Women self-help groups in Manipur through augmentation of infrastructure and value addition of locally grown crops.\t\tCSIR has taken steps to document traditional architecture of rural areas of the Western Himalayan region and is providing need based S&T interventions. CSIR is conducting training programs across country for dissemination, training, demonstration & improvement of appropriate rural housing technologies to various stakeholders and the common man. CSIR imparted training and skill development techniques to terracotta pottery rural artisans across various states and tribal tasar farmers of Telangana state for enhancing their income.CSIR developed and disseminated a number of technologies on water. CSIR deployed arsenic removal technology in villages of West Bengal. CSIR also deployed de-floridation plants and variety of other water purification plants for community/ domestic use in Rural Areas for common people. CSIR is making efforts to provide sustainable/ safe drinking water in drought prone and fluoride affected villages of Nalgonda and Ananatpur districts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Specific plants based Phytorid technology exclusively designed for the treatment of municipal, urban, agricultural and industrial wastewater has been deployed in several parts of country. CSIR\u2019s improved iron removal plants having low cost design and improved aeration have been successfully installed in Bankura (West Bengal) benefitting about 1000 rural people. Additional, 55 plants have been commissioned at different places to cater to needs of about 25000 rural people.CSIR has developed and installed 1-5 kW power Solar Power trees in rural sectors and towns. It takes less land of only 4 sq ft for a 5 kW solar power tree as compared to 400 sq ft of land required in case of the conventional solar photovoltaic layout. CSIR has developed improved biomass chullhas like \u201cNEERDHUR\u201d for household and community level and improved pine needle stove with significant lower emissions for biomass. CSIR has also developed forced draught bio-mass fired cook-stoves with higher efficiency of about 35%. This cook-stove can also operate a forced draught fan or charge a battery. For many of the stoves developed by CSIR, entrepreneurs are eligible for the getting subsidy from Government. CSIR has improved gur bhattis for large number of sugarcane growing villagers. The improved gur bhattis have longer furnace life, consume less fuel (bagasse) and emit less exhaust smoke. CSIR also developed Baggasse drying unit for Gur making plants using waste heat recovery technique. \t\tCSIR\u2019s post-harvest centres in Mizoram (Aizawl) and Arunachal Pradesh (Pashighat) are helping local farmers for value addition to their agricultural produce.

However, the Mission had received a request in February, 2017 where 162 workers employed in M/S Scale Trading & Contracting Company had not received their salary for five months and denied final settlement and exit permit with passport. Mission had taken up the matter with the Qatari authorities. The Mission arranged the air tickets from Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) and repatriated 160 Indian emigrant workers while the remaining 2 opted to continue working in the company.The Government of Qatar launched a Wage Protection System (WPS) in November 2015, which made it mandatory for all companies to pay salaries of their workers directly into their bank accounts. However, there are other reasons also, due to which workers sometimes face problems, such as:(i) \tdisputes with sponsors/company;(ii) \tunderpayment of salary/allowances;(iii) \tnon-payment of overtime;(iv) \tpremature termination of services;(v) \tnon-release of passports; (vi) \tunhygienic living conditions in camps; and(vii) \tnon-availability of proper medical facilities etc.\t \tIndian Missions take up these issues immediately with concerned Government authorities for prompt redressal. \tThe Government has taken several steps to safeguard the interests of Indian emigrants to the Gulf countries, these are: (i) \tThe on-line MADAD portal enables the emigrant workers and their family members to register their consular grievances online and track their redressal. (ii) \tGrievances related  to Overseas Employment in notified Emigration Check Required (ECR) countries including gulf countries, can also be logged in directly by emigrants/relatives or through the Overseas Workers Resource Centre (OWRC) on eMigrate portal. These grievances are settled by respective jurisdictional Protectors of Emigrants (PoEs) as per laid down procedures.(iii)\t\tMissions in Gulf countries also conduct Open Houses on a regular basis where workers can seek redressal of their grievances.(iv)  \tA multi-lingual 24X7 Helpline of Overseas Workers Resource Centre (OWRC) in New Delhi provides information, guidance and grievance redressal on all issues and problems pertaining to overseas employment of Indian nationals. (v)\t\tMissions in Gulf countries have also established 24x7 helplines and Toll Free help lines for the benefit of Indian workers to seek help.(vi)\t\tIndian Workers Resource Centres (IWRC) have been set up at Dubai (UAE), Sharjah (UAE), Riyadh, Jeddah (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), to provide guidance and counselling on all matters pertaining to overseas Indian workers.(vii)\tMigrant Resource Centres in Delhi, Kochi, Hyderabad, Chennai and Lucknow have been merged with PoE Offices for greater synergies in assisting emigrants or their relatives to redress their problems/complaints regarding overseas employment.(viii)\tThe Missions utilise the Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) to provide assistance to overseas Indian nationals in times of distress. (ix)\t\tSuitable accommodation to distressed Indian nationals has been setup in Bahrain, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE and Malaysia to provide temporary accommodation.(x)\tLabour and Manpower Cooperation MoUs/Agreements are already in place with the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries that provide the institutional framework to comprehensively discuss and review labour related issues.(d)\tIn order to promote the welfare and protection of women workers, Government has taken further measures in restricting the recruitment of ECR passport holding Indian female workers only through six State Government recruiting agencies w.e.f. 2nd August, 2016 to avoid their harassment by foreign employers.  The Foreign Employers who intend to recruit Indian female domestic workers directly, have to register themselves on e-Migrate System with the respective Missions and deposit a bank guarantee equivalent to US$2500/-.   The age restriction of 30 years has also been made mandatory in respect of all women emigrants emigrating on ECR passport, irrespective of the nature/category of employment. Further, mandatory Insurance and medical cover is extended to all Indian workers including women, through Pravasi Bhartiya Bima Yojana (PBBY). The Missions are also proactive in providing medical and legal support to distressed Indian women workers and take all possible measures, using ICWF funds for their speedy repatriation to India.

State of Andhra Pradesh falls in East Coast Railway, Southern Railway, South Central Railway and South Western Railway of Indian Railways. Presently 11580 hectares of land (approximately) is vacant in these Zonal Railways.     The vacant land, mostly in the form of narrow strips along the tracks, is used for servicing and maintenance of track, bridges and other railway infrastructure. The vacant land is also utilized for execution of various infrastructural projects for meeting future growth needs of Railways which include projects like doubling/tripling and traffic facilities works, etc. Railway`s operations also necessarily require development of ancillary logistic support/infrastructure such as bulk oil installations & oil depots, steel yards, concrete sleeper plants, coal dumps, connectivity to private sidings, connectivity to ports and other infrastructure, commercial plots, vending stalls, etc. for which land is leased/licensed. The vacant land, which is not required by Railways for its immediate operational needs, is utilized in the interim period for commercial development through Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), wherever feasible, in order to mobilize additional financial resources.  At present, 54 land parcels measuring 189 hectare (approximately) where commercial development seems feasible have been entrusted to RLDA which includes 0.83 hectares of land in Andhra Pradesh.  The land is lying vacant since the inception of Railway lines in these four Zonal Railways.                                                                                               *****"}, {"question_number": "4292", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4292.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4292.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY", "members": ["Rao (Avnthi) Shri Muthamsetti Srinivasa"], "subject": "Mandate of UIDAI", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66139&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "Will the Minister of ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY be pleased to state:(a) whether Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has a mandate to issue a Unique Identification Number (UID) to all residents of India;(b) if so, whether this project is being implemented by the Union Government in coordination with the State Governments; and (c) if so, the details in this regard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        (a): As per Section 11 of Aadhaar Act, 2016, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is responsible for the processes of enrolment and authentication and performs such other functions assigned to it under the Act.(b) and (c): As per sub section 3 of Section 23 of Aadhaar Act, 2016 UIDAI has inter-alia appointed State Governments as Registrar for providing enrolment and update facilities to residents.*******"}, {"question_number": "4291", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4291.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4291.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY", "members": ["Thomas Prof. Kuruppassery Varkey"], "subject": "UID Details Going Public", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66137&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "Will the Minister of ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY be pleased to state:(a) whether the Unique Identification Number (UID) details are going public;(b) if so, whether this will affect the privacy of the individuals; (c) if so, the steps taken by the Government to protect the privacy of the individuals;(d) whether biometric will be used for Aadhaar recognition; and (e) if so, the details thereof?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        (a): No, Sir.

However, National Centre for Seismology (NCS), maintains a country wide national seismological network, to detect and locate earthquakes occurring in and around the country. The network consists of state-of-art digital broadband seismographs, VSAT based communication systems and latest tools for dissemination of earthquake   information   to   the   concerned   disaster   management authorities and other user agencies in least possible time. The network also includes a 17-station real time seismic monitoring system to monitor and report large magnitude earthquakes capable of generating tsunamis on the Indian coastal regions.The Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre (ITEWC) established at Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Sciences (INCOIS), Hyderabad is capable of detecting tsunamigenic earthquakes occurring in the Indian Ocean as well as in the Global Oceans within 10 minutes of the occurrence of the earthquake and disseminates the advisories to the concerned authorities through email, fax, SMS, GTS and website. (d) \tIndian Tsunami Early Warning System comprises a real-time seismic monitoring network of 17 broadband seismic stations established by Indian Meteorological Department to detect tsunamigenic earthquakes. In addition to that, INCOIS is also receiving data from around 90 national seismic stations which are established by various national local/regional centres. INCOIS and National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) have installed 5 Tsunami Buoys in the Bay of Bengal and the 2 Tsunami Buoys in the Arabian Sea. To monitor the progress of tsunami waves, INCOIS has installed 35 tide gauges along the Indian coast and Islands.Real time data from above observational networks transmitting through satellite communication to ITEWC for processing and interpretation with necessary redundancy in transmission. In addition, INCOIS also takes the help of numerical model to assess the tsunami potential at different locations on the coast. The centre is operational round the clock on all days. ITEWC is also receiving data in real time from 350 seismic stations, 50 tsunami buoys and 300 tide gauges established in the Indian as well as the other oceans by other countries and international agencies. A robust communication system also has been employed for the timely reception of data and for the timely dissemination of advisories. ITEWC is considered as one of the most modern tsunami warning centre in the world. Considering the performance of ITEWC, in October 2012, Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO has designated ITEWC as the Tsunami Service Provider (TSP) for the entire Indian Ocean Region. Since then, ITEWC is providing tsunami advisories and related services to all countries on the Indian Ocean rim (25) countries.(e) \tTotal Rs.125 Crore was sanctioned in 2005 by the Govt. of India for the establishment of National Early Warning System for Tsunami and Storm Surges."}, {"question_number": "4276", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4276.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4276.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "MINORITY AFFAIRS", "members": ["Ray, Shri  Partha Pratim"], "subject": "Procedure to Accord Minority Status to any Community", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66140&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a) the number of religious communities treated as minority in our country;(b) whether the Government has any plan of according minority status to Jews or any community and if so, the details thereof ; and (c) the names and number of minority communities who are appointed in the National Commission for Minorities?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)  The Central Government has notified six communities as minorities in the context of India as a whole under Section 2(c) of National Commission for Minorities (NCM) Act, 1992.

A module titled \u2018Marital Disputes\u2019 has been added to it. The distressed Indian woman married to an NRI or any member of her family/friend can register a complaint under this Module. All Indian Missions and Posts abroad, the Branch Secretariats of the Ministry of External Affairs and States/Union Territories have been linked to this portal for consular grievance tracking and follow-up.(b) \tThe MADAD online portal represents a qualitative improvement over existing procedures for handling of consular grievances, through online forwarding, filing, tracking and escalation until their eventual resolution. It allows direct registration of the grievances by the members of the public and effective tracking of the entire grievance handling process all the way until the redressal of the grievance.Between 21 February 2015 and 31st December, 2017, 527 grievances under \u201cMarital Disputes\u201d module of MADAD portal have been received and addressed. \tFurther, the Government has taken following steps to address such issues:  (i)\tBetween January, 2015 and December, 2017 this Ministry (including the Indian Missions abroad) has addressed 3492 complaints of distressed Indian women deserted by their NRI spouses by way of providing them counselling, guidance and information about procedures, mechanisms for serving judicial summons on the Overseas Indian husband; filing a case in India, issuing Look Out Circulars; impounding and revocation of Indian passport of the husband; getting access to lawyers and NGOs empanelled with Indian Missions etc. and legal and financial assistance under ICWF Scheme.(ii)\tWith an aim to provide financial and legal assistance to distressed women married to NRI spouses by all Missions and Posts, the Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) Guidelines were revised in September, 2017.  The amount of legal & financial assistance to distressed Indian women has also been increased to US$ 4000 per case.  The assistance is released to the empanelled legal counsel of the applicant or Indian Community Association / Women\u2019s Organisation/NGO concerned to enable it to take steps to assist the woman in documentation and preparatory work for filing the case. (iii)\tThe Government had set up an Expert Committee on NRI Marital disputes, which presented its Report in August, 2017.  Some of its recommendations including constitution of an Integrated Nodal Agency (INA) have been accepted and implemented and some are under further examination.

In wireless networks, it is a world-wide phenomenon and not unique to any particular country. Call drops may happen in wireless networks due to various reasons like: (i)\tPoor radio coverage- Non availability of suitable tower-locations, may be due to acquisition problems and sealing of towers by local authorities/ Resident Welfare Organization (RWA)/ Owners due to fear of Electro Magnetic Field (EMF) issues;(ii)  \tRadio interference due to use of unauthorized repeaters;(iii)   Change in pattern of traffic- Exponential growth in traffic due to more   use of smart phones which may result in shrinkage of 3G cell size;(iv)\tNon availability of 24x7 power resulting in shutdown of tower/ Base Transceiver Stations (BTS);(v)\tPoor Radio Frequency (RF) optimization efforts: Network Optimization is a process through which different soft parameters (BTS power, neighbour definitions) and hard parameters (e.g. Electrical Tilt, Mechanical Tilt, Azimuth etc.) of the BTS are changed in order to improve the coverage area and quality of signal. \tIn order to resolve the problem of call drop, Government and TSPs have taken various steps like:\u2022\tmaking available sufficient spectrum for mobile services including auction of 965 MHz in 2016, \u2022\tallowing Spectrum Sharing, Trading and liberalisation of administratively allocated spectrum as per the guidelines to facilitate efficient utilisation, \u2022\tpermitting sharing of active as well as passive infrastructure by the telecom service providers for achieving higher utilisation efficiency,\u2022\tnotification of Indian Telegraph Right of Way Rules, 2016 in November 2016 for regulating underground infrastructure (optical fibre) and over-ground infrastructure (mobile towers),\u2022\tperiodic review of expansion of mobile networks and related improvements carried out by the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs)- leading to addition of around 6.66 lakh additional BTS on aggregate basis for 2G/3G/4G services during the period- June 2015 to February 2018, \u2022\tfacilitating use of Government estate for installation of mobile towers   on multiple-sharing basis, \u2022\tlaunching of Tarang Sanchar, a public web portal for information sharing on mobile towers and their EMF compliances, in May 2017.\tAs a result of continuous efforts put-in by the Government and Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), consistent improvements have been noted in compliance to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India\u2019s (TRAI) Quality of service benchmarks for both 2G and 3G services. TRAI has been imposing financial disincentives against service providers who fail to comply with the benchmarks for various quality of service parameters, including for call drop.\tTo monitor the performance of Service Providers on call drop for both 2G and 3G services, TRAI has prescribed two parameters viz. \u201ccall drop rate (benchmark = 2%)\u201d on monthly average basis for the licensed Service Area and \u201cworst affected cells having more than 3% Traffic Channel (TCH) drop/ Circuit Switched Voice drop rate (benchmark = 3%).\u201d  Any Cell with TCH drop/Circuit Switched Voice drop rate > 3% is treated as bad cell whose performance is to be improved.  \tAs per TRAI\u2019s Performance Indicator Report for the quarter July to September 2017, all TSPs providing 2G and 3G services comply to TRAI\u2019s Call drop benchmark of = 2% for Licensed Service Area (LSA) as a whole. \tFurther, compliance to another benchmark, Worst affected cells having Traffic Channel (TCH) drop rate with benchmark = 3% has also improved consistently. For 2G services, non-compliance in this regard has significantly decreased from 54 in quarter ending September 2015 to 20 in quarter ending September 2017. For 3G services, non-compliance in this regard has significantly decreased from 20 to 09 in the corresponding period. \tFurther, the network related parameters were recently reviewed and notified on 18.08.2017. Two new parameters for assessing call drop, viz. DCR spatial distribution measure or DCR Network_QSD (90,90) (benchmark 2%) implies that at-least 90% of Cells in the network should perform better than specified 2% benchmark on at-least 90% of days. Similarly, another new parameter DCR temporal distribution measure or DCR Network_QTD (97,90) will give confidence that on at-least 90% of Days, network performed better than specified 3% benchmark for at-least 97% of the Cells.  Financial Disincentive have also been enhanced from Rs. 1 lakh to 5 lakh for 1st violation and 1.5 to 2 times, capping Rs. 10 lakh for 2nd & subsequent violations. The regulations have since come into force from 1st October, 2017.(d)\tAs per TRAI Reports, BSNL has been consistently complying to call-drop rate benchmark of = 2% for both 2G and 3G services in all operating LSAs for the last four quarters i.e, October to December 2016, January to March 2017, April to June 2017, July to September 2017. Further, BSNL has been complying to second benchmark i.e. Worst affected Cells having more than 3% Traffic Channel (TCH) drop/ Circuit Switched Voice drop rate = 3% for both 2G & 3G services in all operating LSAs except West Bengal during the corresponding last four quarters.\tHence, the overall performance of BSNL mobile networks against call-drop rate benchmarks remains comparable with other TSPs for both 2G & 3G services."}, {"question_number": "4241", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4241.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4241.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "LAW AND JUSTICE", "members": ["Gawali (Patil) Ms. Bhavana", "Sawant Shri Arvind Ganpat", "Kateel Shri Nalin Kumar", "Tumane Shri Krupal Balaji"], "subject": "Appointment of Judges", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=65954&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "Will the Minister of LAW AND JUSTICE be pleased to state:(a) the steps taken by the Government to increase the number of judges in the country;(b) the reasons for the delay in appointment of judges;(c) whether the Government has fixed any time-frame for fulfilling the commitment of appointment of a certain number of judges in the country;(d) if so, the time by which the said appointments are proposed to be made along with the number of the proposed appointments and if not, the reasons therefor; and(e) the total number of judges appointed in the last three years court and year-wise?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR LAW AND JUSTICE AND CORPORATE AFFAIRS(SHRI P.

It requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional Authorities.  Initiation of proposal for appointment of Judges in the Supreme Court vests with the Chief Justice of India, while initiation of proposals for appointment of Judges in the High Courts vests with the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court.While every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies in High Courts do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges and also the increase in strength of Judges.As per the Constitutional framework, the selection and appointment of judges in subordinate courts is the responsibility of the High Courts and State Governments concerned.  In so far as recruitment of judicial officers in the States is concerned, respective High Courts do it in certain States, whereas the High Courts do it in consultation with the State Public Service Commissions in other States.The Supreme Court, through a judicial order in Malik Mazhar case, has devised a process and time frame to be followed for the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary.  This order of January 2007 by the Supreme Court stipulates that the process for recruitment of judges in the subordinate courts would commence on 31st March of a calendar year and end by 31st October of the same year.  The Supreme Court has permitted State Governments / High Courts for variations in the time schedule in case of any difficulty based on the peculiar geographical and climatic conditions in the State or other relevant conditions.

These identified districts have been termed as Aspirational Districts. In Bihar,13 districts have been identified as Aspirational Districts which includes 6 districts identified by Ministry of Home Affairs on the basis of their being affected by Left Wing Extremism. These 13 districts are Katihar, Begusarai, Sheikhpura, Araria, Sitamarhi, Khagaria, Purnia, Aurangabad, Banka, Gaya, Jamui, Muzaffarpur, and Nawada.(b) As seen from above, Sitamarhi is already included in the list of aspirational districts.

The eCourts Mission Mode Project Phase I was implemented during 2011 - 2015 wherein Rs. 251 crores was released for computerisation of district and subordinate courts. At the end of Phase-I, out of the total target of computerisation of 14,249 district and subordinate courts, sites for all 14,249 courts (100%) were made ready for computerisation, out of which LAN was installed at 13,643 courts, hardware provided in 13,436 courts and software was installed in 13,672 courts. Laptops were provided to 14,309 judicial officers and change management exercise was completed in all the High Courts. Over 14,000 Judicial Officers were trained in the use of UBUNTU-Linux Operating System and more than 4000 court staff have been trained in Case Information System (CIS) as System Administrators. Video Conferencing facility was operationalised between 488 court complexes and 342 corresponding jails.Under the Phase II of the Project (2015-19), Rs. 936.98 crores has been released till date against the financial outlay of Rs.1670 crores. Computerisation of 16,089 district and subordinate courts has been completed, through provisioning of computer hardware, Local Area Network (LAN), and installation of standard application software.

QR Code facility has been made operational in the software.  An advance version of CIS NC 3.0 has been made ready for deployment. Till date, 11 High Courts have migrated to Case Information System National Core version 1.0.The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) for District & Subordinate Courts has been created as an online platform which now provides information relating to judicial proceedings/decisions of 16,089 computerized district and subordinate courts of the country. The portal provides online information to litigants such as details of case registration, cause list, case status, daily orders, and final judgments.  Currently litigants can access case status information in respect of over 9 crore cases and more than 6 crore orders / judgments. Litigant centric information can be obtained through the eCourts portal ( https://ecourts.gov.in).  Case information is thus available speedily to the petitioners and respondents. The eCourts portal and National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) also serve as tools of efficient court and case management for judiciary which aids in disposal of pending cases. Judicial Service Centres (JSC) have been established at all computerized subordinate courts to serve as a single window for filing petitions and applications by litigants/ lawyers, and for obtaining information on  ongoing cases and copies of orders and judgments etc. ECourts mobile app with the facility of QR Code was launched on 22.07.2017 for use of litigants and lawyers. Services under different captions viz. Search by CNR, Case Status, Cause List and My Cases are available on this application, which is available on both Google Play and Apple Store. Furthermore, the facility of providing case information services through SMS has also been implemented and the process of disseminating system-generated SMSs is operational. The case details can also be obtained by sending unique CNR number (Case Number Record) to a mobile number through SMS. Cause lists, judgements, case status etc. can be received in the litigants\u2019 mailbox on registration of email address. Information Kiosks have been setup at all computerized court complexes for disseminating judicial information related to cause lists and other case related information to the lawyers and litigants.  An eFiling application to enable the advocates, petitioners-in-person, etc., to file their cases on-line (at any time) has been launched in December 2017 and has been deployed at Delhi district court and successfully tested at City Civil Court, Mumbai.

(b): On the recommendation of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) for conducting all India Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), a nation-wide PLFS has been launched by NSSO from April, 2017 on continuous basis with the objective to measure quarterly changes of key labour force indicators (such as Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), Worker Population Ratio (WPR) & Unemployment Rate (UR)) in urban areas as well as to generate the annual estimates of labour force indicators both in rural and urban areas.  For measuring the labour force indicators, both Current Weekly Status (CWS) and Usual Activity Status (US) approach are followed. In PLFS, a rotational panel sampling design is used in urban area. In this sampling scheme, for the urban areas, 25% of the sample First Stage Units (FSUs) i.e., Urban Frame Survey blocks will be replaced in every subsequent quarter with a new panel of FSUs. The panel will be of two years duration to accommodate the changes in the urban frame. For urban areas, each of the sample households will be visited 4 times, once in a quarter. For rural areas, fresh sample FSUs (i.e. villages) will be selected before commencement of survey for 8 quarters of each two-year period. In rural areas, in each quarter, 25% FSUs of annual allocation will be surveyed. There will not be any revisit in the rural samples households.Annual sample size for the PLFS is 7024 FSUs in the rural areas and 5776 FSUs in the urban areas. From each of the sample FSUs, 8 households (SSUs) are to be surveyed.

The Authority has conducted an Open House Discussion (OHD) on 20.07.2017 in New Delhi, which was attended by many stakeholders. In order to give more deliberation on the issue of International Termination charges, the Authority also conducted a Workshop on \"Review of International Termination Charges\" on 16.10.2017 in New Delhi. The Workshop was attended by International Long Distance Operators (ILDOs) who carry voice traffic to/from India and Access Service Providers.After examining comments of stakeholders and due deliberations, TRAI has issued \"The Telecommunication Interconnection Usage Charges (Fourteenth Amendment) Regulation, 2018\" (2 of 2018) on 12.01.2018, which came into force w.e.f. 01.02.2018. Through this Regulation, the Authority has reduced the termination charges payable by an Indian ILDO to the access provider in whose network the call terminates from Rs.0.53 (paise fifty three only) per minute to Rs.0.30 (paise thirty only) per minute.(b)\tCellular Operators Association of India (COAI) vide its letter dated 25.01.2018 has inter-alia opined that the reduction in the International Termination Charges (ITC) would result in an estimated loss of Rs.2000 crore per annum to the TSPs.(c)\tThe reasons for the Authority to arrive at such a decision are explained in Para 36 & 37 of the Explanatory Memorandum (EM) to the Regulation (Extracts attached). Full text of the Regulation alongwith the EM is available on TRAI website i.e. www.trai.gov.in.Extracts of the Explanatory Memorandum to \"The Telecommunication Interconnection Usage Charges (14th Amendment) Regulation, 2018\" dated 12.01.2018\"36.   Owing to the twin facts viz. \u2014 (a) menace of grey route poses serious security threat to the country apart from causing significant leakage in the revenue accruable to the country and its TSPs, and, (b) proliferation of OTT route for the carrying international voice traffic has many non-cost factors, the Authority is of the view that, while deciding on the appropriate level of ITC in the country, curbing the menace of grey route should be a more important regulatory priority than facilitating the shift of the international incoming traffic from OTT route to carrier route.37.    Essentially, the players engaged in carrying international incoming voice traffic to India through grey route thrive on the significant arbitrage opportunity presently available between the ITC, on one hand, and, tariff for domestic voice call in India plus the cost of running illegal VoIP Gateway, on the other. At present, while ITC is Rs.0.53 per minute, the average tariff for voice call1 is about Rs.0.23 per minute in the country. Besides, there would be certain cost, albeit small, for running an illegal VoIP Gateway. It is expected that if the arbitrage opportunity is plugged or kept to a minimum, the attractiveness of the grey route for carrying international incoming voice traffic would be lost, and thereby, the carrier route for international incoming traffic would witness a legitimate growth. This would not only plug the leakages in the revenue accruable to the country and Indian TSPs, but would also ensure that India continues to earn precious Forex from the International incoming voice traffic business. Accordingly, keeping in view the comments of the stakeholders and the foregoing analysis, the Authority has decided to revise the termination charge for international incoming call to wireline and wireless from Rs.0.53 per minute to Rs.0.30 per minute. The Authority is of the view that, with this revision, the arbitrage opportunity between ITC and domestic call tariffs would become so insignificant that illegal VOIP Gateway business in India would become unviable; in turn, the grey market for ILD incoming traffic would eventually cease to exist.\" 1As per TRAI''s Report titled ''The Indian Telecom Service Performance Indicators (July-September, 2017), the average subscriber outgo per outgoing minute from Home Service Area (HSA) for GSM and LTE Services in Quarter Ending September, 2017 was Rs.0.23 per minute."}, {"question_number": "4195", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4195.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4195.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "DEFENCE", "members": ["Parthipan Shri R."], "subject": "Interoperability among Navy, Army and Air Force", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=66095&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a)\twhether the Government has completed successfully the exercise to build interoperability among Indian Navy, Army, Air Force and Coast Guard recently and if so, the details thereof;(b) \twhether the exercise tested operational readiness of Indian Navy\u2019s Western Command and execution of its operational plans, logistics and administrative plans and if so, the details thereof;(c) \twhether  it also rehearsed defence of Indian offshore assets like oil rigs, escort operations of merchant ships and coastal defence; and(d) \tif so, the details thereof?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF STATE           \t\t(DR.

The proposal was included as an agenda item in the Conference of Chief Ministers and Chief Justices of the High Courts held in April, 2013 wherein it was decided that the issue needs further deliberation and consideration.  The views of the State Governments and High Courts were sought on the proposal.  While some State Governments and High Courts were not in favour of creation of All India Judicial Service, some other State Governments and High Courts wanted changes in the proposal formulated by the Central Government.Only High Courts of Sikkim and Tripura have concurred with the proposal approved by Committee of Secretaries for formation of All India Judicial Service.  High Courts of Allahabad, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Manipur, Meghalaya, Orissa and Uttarakhand have suggested changes in age at induction level, qualifications, training and quota of vacancies to be filled through All India Judicial Service.  Rest of High Courts have not favoured the idea.  Most of the High Courts want the administrative control over the Subordinate Judiciary to remain with the respective High Courts.  The High Courts of Jharkhand and Rajasthan have indicated that the matter regarding creation of AIJS is pending consideration.  No response has been received as yet from the High Courts of Calcutta, Jammu & Kashmir and Gauhati.The State Governments of Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Punjab do not favour the formation of AIJS.  The State Government of Maharashtra wants the recruitment to be done at Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) level which is not in consonance with the provisions of AIJS as included in the Constitution of India.  The State Governments of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Manipur, Orissa and Uttarakhand want changes in the proposal formulated by the Central Government.  The State Government of Haryana has stated that the proposal seems to be justified.  The State Government of Mizoram has supported creation of AIJS on the lines of IAS, IPS and other Central Services.  The State of Jammu and Kashmir has mentioned that provisions of Constitution of India for formation of AIJS incorporated in the Constitution by 42nd Amendment Act, 1976 are not applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  No response has yet been received from rest of the states.The proposal for constitution of All India Judicial Service with views from the High Courts and State Governments received thereon was included in the agenda for the Joint Conference of Chief Ministers and Chief Justices of the High Courts held on 05th April, 2015.  However, no progress was made on the subject.  The matter regarding creation of a Judicial Service Commission to help the recruitment to the post of district judges and review of selection process of judges / judicial officers at all level was also included in the agenda for the Chief Justices Conference, which was held on 03rd and 04th April, 2015, wherein it was resolved to leave it open to the respective High Courts to evolve appropriate methods within the existing system to fill up the vacancies for appointment of District judges expeditiously.However, keeping in view the divergence of opinion among the stakeholders on constitution of All India Judicial Service, the Government has undertaken the consultative process to arrive at a common ground."}, {"question_number": "4182", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4182.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4182.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY", "members": ["Tasa Shri Kamakhya Prasad"], "subject": "R&D Activities in Science and Technology", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=65990&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a)\tthe allocation of funds made for R&D activities in Science and Technology for the State of Assam during the last three years;(b)\tthe details of the researches undertaken during the said period;(c)\tthe steps being taken for the promotion of study of science and technology in the State; and(d)\tthe success achieved therein?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES AND MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(DR.

P. CHAUDHARY)(a) to (e): Data on pendency of cases is maintained by the Supreme Court and High Courts.  As per information available on the web-portal of National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), details of cases pending for more than 10 years in various High Courts including Gujarat High Court are given in a Statement at Annexure.  A total of 1,09,709 cases are pending in Gujarat High Court, out of which 17,032 cases are pending for more than 10 years.Disposal of cases in courts is within the domain of the judiciary.  In pursuance of resolution passed in the Chief Justices\u2019 Conference held in April, 2015, 23 High Courts have set up Arrears Committees to clear the backlog of cases pending for more than five years, except Sikkim High Court where there is no pendency of more than five year old cases.  The Arrear Committees have chalked out Action Plans to reduce pendencies in their respective jurisdictions.  The Supreme Court has also constituted an Arrears Committee consisting of two Hon\u2019ble Judges to formulate steps to reduce pendency of cases in High Courts and District Courts.  At district level, the District Judge holds monthly meeting of all judicial officers to monitor progress made in reduction of long pending cases.Government on its part has taken several measures to facilitate early disposal of cases.  In order to expedite the trial of court cases, legislative changes have been made in procedural laws which include provisions for limiting adjournments of court proceedings in criminal and civil matters as contained in Section 309 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and Order XVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Further, the Government has set up a National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms to achieve twin goals of (i) increasing access to justice by reducing delays and arrears; and (ii) enhancing accountability through structural changes and by setting performance standards and improving capacities.  The Mission has adopted a coordinated approach for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial administration by providing support for better court infrastructure including computerisation, encouraging increase in the strength of subordinate judiciary and recommending policy and legislative measures in the areas prone to excessive litigation and suggesting re-engineering of court procedures for quick disposal of cases.  The challenges posed by huge backlog and pendency of cases in the judicial system cannot be met without the active involvement of judiciary. The Chief Justice of India, after consulting the Minister of Law and Justice established the National Court Management Systems (NCMS) in May, 2012. The \u2018Policy and Action Plan\u2019 document to implement NCMS was released by the Chief Justice of India on 27.9.2012. NCMS is responsible for preparing a policy guideline for developing a National Framework of Court Excellence (NFCE) to set measurable performance standards for Indian courts to address issues of quality, responsiveness and  timely delivery of justice.  All High Courts have constituted State Court Management System (SCMS) to do similar exercise at the State Level.  The Minister of State for Law and Justice vide letter dated 7th February 2017, addressed the Chief Justices of all the High Courts requesting them to speed up the process of implementation of e-Court Project for actualising the objectives of the Project.  The number of computerised District and Subordinate Courts in the country has increased from 13,672 to 16,089.  The Department of Justice has requested Chief Secretaries of all State Governments to utilise the various tools available like the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) database, accessible through http://njdg.ecourts.gov.in/njdg/index.php.  The NJDG\u2019s query builder and management tools functionality enables culling out of information and reports on Act wise, Litigant wise, Date wise, City wise, District wise, Court Establishment/ Court wise and Judge wise legal pendency in both civil and criminal matters.  This can be used to look into state and / or department specific pendencies and  enable steps to be taken at the governments\u2019 end to reduce such pendencies.(f): As per available information, 28, 31 and 31 Judges were working in Gujarat High Court at the end of the calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively.

During April-December, 2017, CIL has produced 383.93 MT which is a growth of 1.6% over the production of 377.77 MT in the corresponding period of 2016-17. Owing to less demand of coal from January to July, 2017 which had resulted into accumulation of coal stock in the pithead of CIL, the production was restricted in the early part of 2017-18. However, the offtake of coal has registered a growth of 8% during April - December, 2017 over the corresponding period of 2016-17. The measures taken to increase the domestic production include expediting Environment Clearances & Forest Clearances, pursuing with State Government for assistance in land acquisition and coordinating with Railways for movement of coal. A roadmap has been prepared by CIL to substantially enhance production of coal by 2019-20. This includes capacity addition from new projects, use of mass production technologies and identification of existing on-going projects with growth potential. (f): Some of the measures taken by CIL to curtail its expenses and increase its profit include the following: i)    Introduction of e-tendering with reverse auction in procurement of high value goods and services including explosives. ii)   Planning for high capacity OC mines with introduction of large sized HEMMs with emphasis on surface Miners in suitable mining conditions. iii)  Up-gradation of HEMMs in existing OC mines with an aim to introduce high capacity equipment with standardized configuration. iv) Planning for high capacity UG mines with introduction of Mass production technology. v)   Converting the existing unsafe UG mines into OC mines to extract the balance reserves, wherever feasible.  vi)  Staggering of rest days of employees to reduce the adverse impact of Sunday wages on salary and wages cost. vii) Introduction of GPS/GPRS based vehicle tracking system to check the pilferage of coal during transportation.   ****"}, {"question_number": "4166", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4166.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4166.pdf", "date": "21.03.2018", "ministry": "PLANNING", "members": ["Nete Shri Ashok Mahadeorao"], "subject": "Skill Training", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=65930&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a) whether the NITI Aayog proposes to find out the requirements of skill development and shortcomings in training programmes in the country;(b) if so, the details of the areas identified for the purpose;(c) whether more than 10 crore workforce are likely to enter the labour market by the year 2022 and require skill training as per the 68th round of the National Sample Survey; and(d) if so, the details thereof along with the  measures taken by the Government in this regard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS                                     (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)\t& (b): NITI Aayog constituted three Sub-Groups for identifying the skill requirements/gaps in the infrastructure sectors of Power and Energy, Transport and Telecommunication alongwith the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship.

The renewable energy sources like solar, wind etc are intermittent and also location specific. A detailed analysis of the economic viability of each nuclear power project is carried out as a part of the project proposal while seeking project financial sanction from the Government. The tariffs of nuclear power are competitive to other base load technologies for generation of electricity in the region. An independent Environmental Survey Laboratory (ESL) is set up at each of the nuclear power plant site several years before setting up of the plant, which regularly analyses environmental matrices like air, water, soil, vegetation, crops, milk, fish, etc. around each of the nuclear power plant (NPP) site. The data collected, over the years, has established that there is negligible change in radioactivity and radiation levels in the environment / environmental matrices due to operation of the nuclear power plants. In addition, epidemiological survey for heath assessment in respect of employees working in the nuclear power plants and their families, who stay in the nearby township and villages, have been carried out for the nuclear power plant sites by reputed local medical colleges and the analysis has been carried out by Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, the premier cancer research centre of the country. All these studies have established that there are no adverse effects of the operation of the nuclear power plants on the people living in and around the plants.\t (c)\tDoes not arise.(d)\tNuclear power is clean with lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions comparable to renewables and has huge potential which can provide long term energy security to the country in a sustainable manner.

STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF PARTS (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 355 TO BE ANSWERED ON 20/03/2018 REGARDING \u201cPRODUCTIVITY OF AGRICULTURE SECTOR\u201d(a)\tThe productivity of agriculture sector in India is not the lowest in the world. Presently the country\u2019s productivity levels in different crops are much better than many countries and global productivity level of our major crops is as under:Sr. No.\tCrop\tRank for productivity1.\tWheat\t52.\tGroundnut\t63.\tSugarcane\t74.\tPulses \t95.\tPaddy\t96\tMaize\t10The productivity of agriculture depends on various factors like agro climatic conditions, adoption of improved technology, crop growing period, biotic and abiotic stresses, etc. Despite these, India has made a commendable progress in genetic enhancement of different crops and the productivity levels have increased to three times (2000 kg/ha) during 2016-17 from 710 kg/ha during 1960-61. The present total food grain production of 275.68 million tonnes has been achieved mainly due to enhancement in productivity. In addition to productivity per se per day productivity is also one of the major component for determining the genetic potential of crops. Per day productivity of major crops in India is better or at par with any of the high productivity countries. India has multiple cropping system with high cropping intensity whereas in high productivity countries the crops are taking longer maturity duration due to which only one crop can be taken and cropping intensity is low in comparison to India. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) focuses at harnessing conventional and modern scientific knowledge, tools, and cutting-edge science for development of improved crop varieties/hybrids suited to diverse agro-ecologies situations, climate smart management and protection technology by promoting excellence in basic, strategic and anticipatory research. Further, seed technology research and production of breeder seed of hybrids/varieties is also an important programme.  Adoption of modern technologies such as abiotic stress tolerant crop varieties in situ moisture conservation, crop diversification, integrated farming system and contingent crop planning to increase the production of agricultural produce in the country. These efforts have resulted in the highest ever production of food grains 275.68 million tonnes during 2016-17. India\u2019s horticulture production with about 299.8 million tons from 24.85 million hectare during 2016-17 has not only brought prosperity to small and marginal farmers, but also provided food and nutritional security to the Nation. Ranked as the second largest producer of Fruits & Vegetables in the world, horticulture in India has today emerged as one of the vibrant part of Indian agriculture. The country ranks at first position in the production of Banana, Mango, Lime & Lemon, Papaya and Okra.  With 165.4 million tonnes ICAR\u2019s efforts in this direction has been multidimensional right from taking up research in agricultural Sector from development of high yielding varieties to developing cutting edge technologies enabling farmers to boost their productivity.(b)\tThe National Agricultural Research System (NARS), which serves the agricultural technology and information needs of the country, has created a research network of 102 ICAR Research Institutes, 11 Agricultural Technology Application Research Institutes (ATARIs) and 73 Agricultural Universities (including 3 Central Agricultural Universities and 5 Universities with Agriculture Faculty) spread across the country. DARE/ICAR has also established a network of 686 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) district-wise in the country aiming at assessment and demonstration of technologies/ products developed under NARS and their dissemination among the farmers and line departments through their district level front line demonstration and training programmes. The Council is addressing these aspects through research integration, need-based education and inclusive frontline extension programmes which are playing significant role in the National Food and Nutritional Security. The ICAR research institutes have taken up basic and strategic research programmes related to crop/fruit improvement and development of production and protection technologies to form a base for applied research. The information so developed is used by respective All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRPs) and All India Network Projects (AINPs) being carried out in ICAR Institutes and State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) to develop location specific varieties and technologies as per the agro ecological needs for enhancing the production and productivity. Moreover, various novel and cutting edge science-based research programmes are being pursued besides up-scaling the already developed technologies for maximizing the returns in agriculture for overall development of the country. The research programmes are being prioritized to develop new high yielding pest resistant varieties of food crops, pulses, fodder and commercial crop varieties. New research programs have basic, strategic and applied research related to crop improvement, crop production, crop protection, post-harvest operations, value addition, etc. have been taken up. Also, research efforts are on towards judiciously integrating conventional plant breeding, molecular biology, bioinformatics, genetic engineering, human resource and infrastructural development to make the country self-reliant in the agriculture sector.To further strengthen the Govt. initiative on Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India including North East, Rajendra Agricultural University has been upgraded to Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) has been established at Barhi, Jharkhand on the lines of IARI, PUSA, New Delhi and another IARI is being established in Assam, six new colleges started under Central Agricultural University, Imphal. National Research Centre for Integrated Farming established in Motihari (Bihar) and National Organic Farming Research Institute established in Tadong (Sikkim). Basides these, ICAR established six new Regional Research Stations in MP, Karnatka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and West Bengal and opened 2 new colleges opened under Rani Laxmibai Central Agricultural University, Jhansi. Financial support has been extended to Telengana, Andhra Pradesh, and Haryana Governments for the establishment of new Agriculture and Horticulture Universities. As a result of various initiatives by the Government ICAR/ NARS has developed 645 high yielding climate resilient crop varieties / hybrids of field crops have been released for cultivation in different agro-ecologies of the country during the last 3.5 years. Besides, 130 improved varieties of 54 important horticultural crops were also developed by ICAR.  ICAR has also developed and validated 623 district contingency plans and conducted skill development programs for 40.9 lakh farmers. ICAR has also developed 45 Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) models in 23 states and 1 Union Territory covering all the 15 agro-climatic regions of the country. These models are being promoted through 462 KVKs in the country. ICAR has also developed 42 Organic Farming Technologies which have been tested and refined through 20 Centres of the AICR project on organic farming across 20 states including 7 north eastern states.(c)\tMinistry of Agriculture and Farmer\u2019s Welfare have signed twenty five MoUs/Agreements relating to agriculture and allied areas during 01/01/2015-13/03/2018.  Besides these, ICAR has also signed MoUs with eight foreign universities/organisations for Capacity Building, Germ-Plasm Exchange etc. A MoU for establishment of BRICS Agricultural Research Platform was also signed to focus on agricultural research, technology, policy, innovations, extension and technology transfer, training and capacity building and information sharing among BRICS countries. Besides India has developed very active collaboration with Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) system, an international organization that advances international agricultural research for a food secure future by integrating and coordinating efforts of those who fund research and do the research for strengthening the national programmes and works through 15 Research Centres. India is a donor member of country of CGIAR system and now has also become a voting member of newly restructured CGIAR System. India contributed an amount of Rs. 55.763 Crores to CGAIR institutions during year 2017-18.(d)\tThe benefits accrued / likely to accrue from these agreements are in the form of enhancement of exchange of knowledge, transfer of appropriate technologies, sharing of equipment, exchange of genetic material, research and capacity building and skill development programs for the development of the agricultural sector besides providing training and visiting facilities in respective countries, visit of farmers and farmer organization, providing opportunities for advanced research and higher education in agriculture in other countries in various spheres of agriculture. These also provide our scientists the opportunity to contribute in tackling the National/International challenges which very often go beyond the boundaries as well as to contribute effectively towards ensuring food and nutrition security for the global community.******"}, {"question_number": "354", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AS354.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AS354.pdf", "date": "20.03.2018", "ministry": "AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE", "members": ["Usendi Shri Vikram"], "subject": "Organic Fertilizers", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=65669&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a) \tthe details of the organic fertilizers used in agriculture; (b)\t whether organic fertilizers have proved to be effective scientifically in agriculture and if so, the details thereof along with the details of the benefits of organic fertilizers in comparison to inorganic fertilizers; (c) \twhether the Government is aware that various organic fertilizers are sold in the market at higher rates and if so, the details thereof along with the steps taken to check/control its prices; and (d) \tthe various measures taken by the Government to produce organic fertilizers in the country?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ??????  \u00bd\u00e3\u00e2\u00a8\u00e3\u00e3\u00e8\t\t \t  (SHRI RADHA MOHAN SINGH) (a) to (d):\tA statement is laid on the Table of the House.

The organic carbon content is vital for maintaining and enhancing soil fertility. In order to enhance the efficacy of chemical fertilizers and for improving crop response to the applied fertilizers, use of organic fertilizers is required. Government is recommending soil test based integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources of plant nutrients.  Organic fertilizers have been tested scientifically in ICAR institutions and SAUs on various crops and soil types and found suitable for improving soil health and productivity. These organic fertilizers presently available may supplement costly chemical fertilizers (N,P) by nearly 20-25%. Biofertlizers when applied along with compost @ 5t/ha, or vermicompost @2t/ha, fertilizers saving is almost 50%.              The advantages of these organic fertilizers over chemical/ inorganic fertilizers are (i) they are eco friendly and (ii) not only provide nutrients for maintaining soil fertility but also improve soil physical & biological health.(c):     No such reports have been brought to notice to the Government .The Government of India is not regulating the price of organic fertilizers.  Its prices are determined by market forces.(d):       Government is promoting organic fertilizers/ biofertilizers through various schemes of National Mission of Sustainable Development (NMSA)/ Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana and supported by Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) and National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP), National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).

The Act provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural population and upto 50% of the urban population for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the population or atleast 81.34 crore persons, at Census 2011 population. Corresponding to the above coverage at All India level, State-wise percentage coverage has been determined by the then Planning Commission (now Niti Aayog). Under the Act eligible households, which comprise of Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households and priority households, are entitled to receive foodgrains @ Rs 1/2/3 per kg for coarse grain/wheat/rice respectively. While priority households are entitled to receive 5 kg per person per month, AAY households, which constitute the poorest of the poor, continue to receive 35 Kg of foodgrains per household per month. Allocation of foodgrains to States/UTs are made based on the percentage coverage as determined for them, beneficiaries identified by each State/UT and scale of distribution indicated above.The Central Government decontrolled the sugar sector by removing the levy obligation on sugar mills from 2012-13 sugar season. After deregulation of sugar sector, a new dispensation for distribution of sugar under PDS was put in place w.e.f. 01.06.2013 wherein State Government/UT Administrations were required to procure sugar from the open market through transparent system. The Central Government had been reimbursing a fixed sugar subsidy @ Rs. 18.50 per kg to the participating States/UTs towards distribution of sugar under Public Distribution System (PDS) to the targeted population covering BPL population and all the population of North Eastern States /Special Category States/Hilly states and Island Territories as per 2001 Census to make sugar available at the retail issue price of is Rs. 13.50 per kg. The Government of India has reviewed the Sugar Subsidy Scheme in May 2017 and decided that the existing system of sugar distribution through PDS may be continued with restrictive coverage of AAY families only. They will be provided @ 1 kg of sugar per AAY family per month for which subsidy of Rs. 18.50 per kg will continue to be provided by the Central Government to participating States/ UTs. The States/UTs are also allowed either to absorb the additional cost on account of handling,transportation and dealers\u2019 commission or pass it on to the consumer by...2/-...2...adding it to the Retail Issue Price (RIP) of Rs.13.50 per kg under the Public Distribution System (PDS). The revised guidelines for reimbursement of sugar subsidy to State/UTs for distribution of sugar under PDS for AAY families have been issued to all States/UTs in June 2017. The Government of Uttar Pradesh has not yet given its consent towards participation in the sugar subsidy scheme. The annual admissible quota of sugar of Uttar Pradesh state under the sugar subsidy scheme for AAY families will be 49,134 MT.Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas makes allocation of PDS Kerosene to States/UTs on quarterly basis for the purpose of cooking and lighting only. Further distribution of the PDS Kerosene within the States/UTs under PDS network to various categories of ration card holders / consumers is made by the concerned State/UT. Scale and criteria of distribution are also decided by the respective State/UT. The allocation of PDS Kerosene of the States/UTs including Uttar Pradesh has been rationalized on the basis of factors such as increase in domestic LPG/PNG connections, increase in electricity coverage, non-lifting of PDS kerosene quota by the concerned States/UTs etc.The details of foodgrains (rice and wheat), allocated to Uttar Pradesh during the last five years is as under:Sl.

STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 348    DUE FOR REPLY ON 20TH MARCH, 2018.(a):  \t   As per the information received from the State Government of Maharashtra, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed to investigate last year''s pesticide poisoning deaths in Yavatmal district of Vidarbha has suggested a ban on Monocrotophos across the State.  According to SIT report, it was found that Monocrotophos was mixed with other pesticides for spraying which was not scientifically approved. The State Government of Maharashtra vide Notification No. CPS1117/CR204117-A, dated 01.11.2017 under provision of sub section (1) of section 27 of the Insecticide Act 1968 has temporally prohibited the use of Monocrotophos 36 % SL for 60 days.(b) & (c):\t The Registration Committee, constituted under Section 5 of the Insecticides Act, 1968 registers pesticides after considering its efficacy and safety to human beings, animals and environment. In additions, technical reviews are carried out from time to time to assess the safety of pesticides for their continued use. Pesticides used as per the approved label claims and leaflets are unlikely to cause any harm. Monocrotophos and Oxydemeton-methyl are registered under the Insecticides Act 1968, for use in the Country.  However, the Monocrotophos is banned for use on vegetables.  The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW)   has   constituted    an expert committee under the Chairmanship of Anupam Verma in July 2013, to review 66 pesticides, including Monocrotophos, that are banned, restricted, withdrawn in one or more countries but continued to be registered in India. The list of such pesticides is at Annexure I. The expert Committee inter alia, recommended for continued use of Monocrotophos and to review it in 2018 after completion of certain technical studies. Contd\u20262/--2-(d) & (e):\t Monitoring of quality of pesticides is a shared responsibility between the Central and State Governments. Central Government and State Governments have notified 182 and 10500 Insecticides Inspectors respectively to check sale of misbranded pesticides. Insecticide samples are drawn on regular basis and analyzed in 69 State Pesticides Testing Laboratories (SPTLs) and at the two Regional Pesticides Testing Laboratories at Chandigarh and Kanpur. Action is initiated under the provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968 against those samples which are found misbranded. During 2014-15 to 2016-17, a total of 195925 have been analyzed, out of which 5460 (2.8%) samples have been found misbranded.The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has established 35 Central Integrated Pest Management Centres (CIPMCs) across the Country. These CIPMCs, inter alia, conduct Farmers Field Schools (FFSs) to sensitize farmers on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, and safe and judicious use of chemical pesticides as a last resort as per approved labels and leaflets. In the last three years, a total of 1971 FFSs have been organized, sensitizing 59130 farmers.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has established National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM) as an autonomous body. The National Institute of Plant Health Management is mandated to promote environmentally sustainable Plant Health Management practices in diverse and changing agro-climatic conditions, Bio security & Incursion Management through capacity building programmes for farmers and State Agriculture/Extension functionaries. Furthermore, Regular advisories on pest management are being shared with the States for their timely dissemination to the farmers through their extension functionaries. The State Governments through various forums such as Zonal Conferences and National Conference are requested to exhort their extension functionaries to educate and impart training to farmers on efficacious and sustainable pest management strategies and approaches."}, {"question_number": "347", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AS347.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AS347.pdf", "date": "20.03.2018", "ministry": "HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS", "members": ["Hooda Shri Deepender Singh"], "subject": "Regional Rapid Transit System", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=65702&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "Will the Minister of HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS be pleased to state:(a)\tthe status of work relating to the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) in respect of Delhi-Sonepat-Panipat, Delhi-Bahadurgarh-Rohtak-Hisar, Delhi-Gurgaon-Alwar and Delhi-Faridabad-Palwal corridors;(b)\tthe dates on which the said proposals were sent/forwarded by the State Government of Haryana;(c)\tthe outcome of the Pre-feasibility and Feasibility Study Reports for these RRTS corridors; and(d)\tthe funds allocated and released including the period of allocation for development of aforesaid RRTS corridors? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS(SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) to (d):\tA statement is laid on the Table of the House.                          *******                               STATEMENTSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *347 FOR ANSWER ON 20TH MARCH, 2018 REGARDING REGIONAL RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM ASKED BY SHRI DEEPENDER SINGH HOODA.(a):\t\tAt present, the following three prioritized Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridors have been planned for implementation: (i)\tDelhi-Gurugram-Alwar (ii)\tDelhi-Sonepat-Panipat (iii)\tDelhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut The RRTS corridors of Delhi-Bahadurgarh-Rohtak and Delhi-Faridabad-Palwal corridors are not under consideration.

(c):    Yes, Madam. Government is implementing various schemes/ programmes to strengthen storage infrastructure for procurement of crops in the country. The subsidy linked Central Sector Scheme, i.e., Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), sub scheme of Integrated Scheme of Agricultural Marketing (ISAM), is being implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers\u2019 Welfare in order to improve/create scientific storage capacity for storing farm produce, processed farm produce and to reduce post harvest storage losses. Under this scheme, 65.14 Million MT storage capacity has been sanctioned so far (as on 31-01-2018). Against the overall storage capacity required for the central pool of foodgrains of about 600 lakh metric tonnes, the total capacity available with Food Corporation of India (FCI)    and State    Agencies for storage  of foodgrains as on 31.01.2018 is 735.46 lakh Contd\u20262/--2-metric tonnes. However, to augment capacities in specific areas and to modernize the storage facilities in the country, Government is implementing Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme; Central Sector Scheme for Construction of Godowns in North Eastern States along with Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Kerala; and Action Plan for Construction of Steel Silos. (d):     Union Government is implementing various schemes/ programmes to promote non-farm employment opportunities for the farmers. In particular, Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing Scheme for Creation of Infrastructure for Agro Processing Clusters under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana to incentivize the setting up of 100 agro processing clusters in the country. These clusters would add value to the horticultural/ agricultural produce and reduce wastage of the surplus produce and thereby resulting in increase of income of the farmers and creation of employment opportunities at the local level.  (e):      With a view to increase benefits of farming to the poor farmers, Government is implementing various schemes and programmes focused on promoting share cropping and encouraging mixed cropping. The major schemes for assisting the farmers in making farming more beneficial are: Crop Diversification Programme under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY); Rainfed Area Development under National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture; National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP); and Sub-Mission on Agro-Forestry. Government has also set up 690 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and 676 Agricultural Technology Management Agencies (ATMAs) at district level  for dissemination of technologies among farm community. In addition, farmers are Contd..3/--3-provided information through Focused Publicity Campaigns, Kisan Call Centres (KCCs), Agri-Clinics and Agri-Business Centres (ACABC) of entrepreneurs, Agri Fairs and exhibitions, Kisan SMS Portal, etc.In addition, a Model Act on Agricultural Land Leasing has been suggested by the NITI Aayog to facilitate the States for enactment of their own land leasing laws. This may facilitate share cropping by encouraging the land owners to lease out without any fear of losing land right; and enabling the tenant farmers to access bank credit, insurance, disaster relief and other support services. ********"}, {"question_number": "342", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AS342.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AS342.pdf", "date": "20.03.2018", "ministry": "AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE", "members": ["Kumar Shri Ashwini"], "subject": "Minimum Support Price", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=65663&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a) \twhether the Government is aware that some middlemen purchase the agricultural produce from small farmers at lower rates and sell the same to the Government agencies to get the minimum support price; (b)\t if so, the details thereof; and (c)\tthe steps taken by the Government to help both the registered and unregistered farmers in this regard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ??????  \u00bd\u00e3\u00e2\u00a8\u00e3\u00e3\u00e8\t\t \t  (SHRI RADHA MOHAN SINGH) (a) to (c):\tA statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 342    DUE FOR REPLY ON 20TH MARCH, 2018.(a) to (c):\tUnder the procurement mechanism in the country, as per the prescribed guidelines, Central Government agencies procure Oilseeds, Pulses and Cotton  of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) at Minimum Support Price (MSP) from through the concerned State Government agencies as and when market price of these produce fall below the MSP. Under this procurement mechanism stocks are purchased by Cooperative Societies, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPO) and Farmer Producer Companies, directly from genuine farmers having legitimate land record to eliminate possibility of middlemen taking advantage of the scheme. Further, payments  are made through Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)/National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) and account payee cheque by the procuring agencies directly into farmers accounts. Procurement of Wheat and Paddy is undertaken through Food Corporation of India (FCI) and State agencies across the country whenever food grains are offered by farmers within stipulated period and conforming to the prescribed specifications at MSP for central pool. However, in the State of Haryana and Punjab, the procurement of wheat and paddy is being undertaken through Arhatiya as per the provisions of relevant Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act. Arhatiya is also involved in some parts of Rajasthan. State Governments of these States have been requested to do direct payment to farmers. However, if farmers get better price in comparison to MSP, they are free to sell their produce in open market.     To ensure procurement from genuine farmers in most of the States, pre-registration of farmers is encouraged to rule out the possibility of  involvement of middlemen as well as  avoid  long waiting by farmers at procurement centres. ******"}, {"question_number": "341", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AS341.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AS341.pdf", "date": "20.03.2018", "ministry": "HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS", "members": ["Shinde Dr. Shrikant Eknath", "Raut Shri Vinayak Bhaurao"], "subject": "Housing for All", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=65700&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "Will the Minister of HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS be pleased to state:(a)\twhether the Smart Cities Mission aims to modernise 100 cities by 2020;(b)\tif so, whether the plan to spruce up central business districts and build metro lines has triggered eviction of people from slums and informal settlements; (c)\twhether 53, 700 homes were destroyed during the last one year by authorities in cities, towns and villages, uprooting at least 2,60,000 people without following due process such as giving communities sufficient notice or offering adequate resettlement and if so, the details thereof and the reaction of the Government thereto; (d)\twhether the Government is aware that the implementation of the Housing for All  initiative meant to create 20 million new urban housing  units and 30 million rural homes by 2022, has been slow, if so, the reasons therefor and the corrective steps being taken by the Government in this regard; and(e)\twhether the Government has any proposal for greater investment in social rental housing and if so, the details thereof? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THEMINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS(SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)\tto (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House.\t                             *****                           STATEMENTSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.*341 FOR ANSWER ON 20.03.2018 REGARDING HOUSING FOR ALL.

(b) to (f): The main hurdles, identified in the food processing sector are like inadequate link between production and processing (lack of process able varieties), lack of product development and innovation, seasonality of operations and low capacity utilization, supply chain institutional gaps, gaps in infrastructure of supply chain etc.      For the overall growth and development of the food processing sector in the country, the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has been implementing various Central Sector Schemes.   The MoFPI has re-structured its schemes under the new Central Sector Scheme of PRDHAN MANTRI KISAN SAMPADA YOJANA (PMKSY) with an allocation of    Rs.6,000 crore for period 2016-20 co-terminus with the 14th Finance Commission cycle. In addition to the existing scheme components of  Mega Food Parks; Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure; Food Safety and Quality Assurance Infrastructure; and  Human Resources and Institutions, PMKSY encompasses three new schemes namely; Infrastructure for Agro-Processing Clusters, Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages  and Creation/Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities with the objective to create robust modern infrastructure along the entire value chain in food processing with a view to, inter alia, increase the level of food processing and reduce wastage. Further, to provide impetus to the growth and development of food processing Industry in the country, Government has taken a number of policy initiatives like permitting 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) through automatic route in manufacturing of food products and 100% FDI under Government approval route for trading, including through e-commerce, in respect of food products produced and/or manufactured in India; creation of a special fund of Rs.2000 crores with National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) to provide affordable credit; classification of food & agro-based processing units and cold chain as agriculture activity for Priority Sector Lending; lower Goods & Services Tax (GST) rates for majority of food products, 100% exemption of income tax on profit for new food processing units, etc., to attract investment in the sector and boost the level of processing.      The MoFPI has entered into agreements with France and Italy for bilateral cooperation in food processing sector. In addition, MoUs have also been signed with various foreign Universities/Institutes by the two autonomous institutions under the MoFPI like National Institute of Food Technology Entrepreneurship and Management (NIFTEM) at Kundli, Haryana and Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT) at Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu for cooperation in the areas of teaching, research and skill development. Further, during the event of World Food India 2017 in November 2017, MoUs were signed by MoFPI with foreign companies of different countries. *****"}, {"question_number": "4133", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU4133.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU4133.pdf", "date": "20.03.2018", "ministry": "AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE", "members": ["Gopal Dr. K."], "subject": "Decline in Population of Indigenous Breeds of Cattle", "link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=65834&lsno=16", "meta": {"current_page": 1267, "total_pages": 7757, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-06 01:25:32.493249"}, "text": "(a) whether it is true that there has been a rapid decline in the population of indigenous breeds of cattle across the country and if so, the reasons therefor;(b) whether it is also true that the Government held discussions with the State Governments in this regard;(c) if so, the details and the outcome thereof; and(d) the steps taken by the Government to protect the indigenous breeds of cattle in the country?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\nANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE(SHRIMATI KRISHNA RAJ)(a) As per breed survey report 2013 the country has 37.92 million animals of recognized indigenous cattle breeds as against 23.78 million animals of indigenous cattle breeds during 2007 (as per breed wise livestock census 2007).

R. CHAUDHARY)(a): No, Madam. On the basis of peak stock requirement during procurement season, the overall storage capacity required for central pool food grains in the country is about 600 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT). Against this, the total storage capacity available with Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and the State Agencies, both owned and hired capacity, was 735.46 LMT as on 31.01.2018. This comprised 611.31 LMT covered godowns and 124.15 LMT cover and plinth (CAP) storage. Thus, sufficient storage facilities are available central pool foodgrains stock in the country. In Karnataka the storage capacity is sufficient to stock about 4-1/2 months\u2019 requirement under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The State-wise details are at Annexure-I....2/-...2...(b): As per a study conducted for the year 2012-13 by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare through Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET), total losses that occurred during harvesting and post-harvest stages were 5.53% and 4.93% of the production of paddy and wheat respectively. However, as regards the foodgrains procured and stocked by the Government/FCI in central pool, the quantities wasted are very minimal. The total quantum of wheat and rice handled by FCI during the last three years and the current year upto 01.02.2018 (excluding stocks of decentralised procurement States) is 1836.56 lakh tonnes, out of which only 0.334 lakh tonnes got damaged due to rain, flood, cyclone, negligence, transit etc.(c) & (d): The details of quantities of foodgrains stored in godowns in the Central Pool as on 1st June (peak stock) of last 2 years State-wise including Karnataka is given in Annexure-II.No damage of foodgrains can be attributed to lack of proper storage facilities. The foodgrains are stored scientifically with various preservation measures like fumigation and treatment with pesticides.In spite of taking necessary care and precautions, small quantities of foodgrains become non-issuable or rotten due to various reasons like:I. Transit damages viz enroute damage in wagon/truck due to contamination, wagon roof leakage etc.II. Due to natural calamities like cyclone/flood/heavy rains.III. Possibility of down gradation of grains which are procured under relaxed specifications.IV. In some cases due to negligence of officials/ officers, for which suitable disciplinary action against defaulters, where ever found guilty, are invariably taken.In order to augment capacities in specific areas and to modernize the storage facilities, the Government has been implementing the following schemes:I. Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme: Under this Scheme, which was formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by FCI. During the last three years i.e. 2014-15 to 2017-18 (as on 31.01.2018) a capacity of 21.91 Lakh MT has been completed....3/-...3...II. Central Sector Scheme: This scheme is implemented in the North Eastern States along with Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Kerala. Funds are released by the Government to FCI and also directly to the State Governments for construction of godowns. During the last three years i.e. 2014-15 to 2017-18 (as on 31.01.2018) a capacity of 1.54 Lakh MT has been completed under the scheme.III. Construction of steel silos: Government of India has also approved action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT, for modernizing the storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored food grains. During the last three years i.e. 2014-15 to 2017-18 (as on 31.01.2018) tenders have been awarded for a capacity of 38.50 LMT and a capacity of 6.25 LMT silos has already been added under the above action plan.****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4122 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 20.03.2018 IN THE LOK SABHA.Storage Capacity with FCI and State Govt.Agencies as on 31.01.2018.(Figures in LMT)ZoneSl.
