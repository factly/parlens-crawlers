This reduction can be attributed to increase in population, rapid urbanization & industrialization and other related factors.  As per year 2001 census, the average annual per capita availability of water in the country was 1816 m3/year, which has reduced to 1545 m3/year as per 2011 census.  Further, projections for the year 2025 and 2050 are 1340 m3/year & 1140 m3/year respectively.\t\tAs per the report of the \u2018Task Force on Irrigation, 2009\u2019 of the erstwhile Planning Commission, ground water meets nearly 55% of irrigation requirements of the country besides meeting more than 85% of water requirement for domestic use in rural areas and over 50% for Urban areas. \t\tGround Water Resource Assessment of the Country is being periodically carried out jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments.   During the assessment year 2013, out of 6584 assessment units in the country, 1034 assessment units are categorized as \u201cOver-Exploited\u201d.\t\tAs per Reassessment of Water Availability Studies carried out in 1993, the average annual water availability in the country has been assessed as 1869 BCM (Billion Cubic Meter).  It is estimated that owing to topographic, hydrological and other constraints, the utilizable water is 1123 BCM which comprises of 690 BCM of surface water and 433 BCM of replenishable ground water resources.Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management to ensure sustainability of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. Participatory ground water management is one of the viable strategies for sustainable management of ground water. In order to encourage participatory ground water management, Government has proposed Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABHY) aimed at sustainable ground water management with community participation in selected over-exploited and ground water stressed areas in seven States (Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh).  ABHY is designed as a Central Sector Scheme with a total outlay of Rs. 6,000 Crore and is proposed to be implemented with World Bank assistance.Other, steps taken by the Central Government for conservation of ground water are available at the following URL http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/MeasuresForGW-Depletion_1.pdf.*****"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=63740&lsno=16", "qref": "63740", "question_number": "2235", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU2235.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU2235.pdf", "date": "08.03.2018", "ministry": "INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING", "members": ["Singh Dr. Krishn Pratap"], "subject": "Telecast of Objectionable Contents", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a) \twhether the Government has received a large number of complaints from viewers/audiences regarding so-called objectionable contents being telecast/broadcast on several TV channels and radio stations; (b) \tif so, the steps taken or proposed to be taken for safeguarding the interests and fundamental rights of viewers in the country; and(c)\t whether the Government proposes to set up a statutory mechanism for the redressal of complaints against the contents of private TV channels and radio stations; and(d) \tif so, the details thereof?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION & BROADCASTING     [COL RAJYAVARDHAN RATHORE (Retd.)] (a) to (d):  Complaints are received directly and also through the public grievance portal i.e http://pgportal.gov.in relating to the content telecast on private TV channels.

FM Radio Channels are required to comply with the terms & conditions of the Grant of Permission Agreement (GOPA) which is executed by them with the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting at the time of granting permission to run FM radio channels. Clause 7.6 of the GOPA provides that the permission holder shall ensure that no content, messages, advertisement or communication, transmitted in its Broadcast Channel is objectionable, obscene, unauthorized or inconsistent with the laws of India.         \tMinistry has also constituted a composite Inter Ministerial Committee (IMC) comprising officers from Ministries of Home Affairs, Defence, External Affairs, Law & Justice, Women & Child Development, Health & Family Welfare, Consumer Affairs and a representative from Advertising Standards Council of India, to take cognizance suo moto or to look into specific complaints regarding content on private TV channels on any platform  including  FM  Radio  channels.  As  and  when  there  is  a prima facie case of Contt\u2026..2/--2-violation by private satellite TV channels and private FM channels regarding content aired by them, the matter is placed before the IMC for its consideration/recommendations. Thus, IMC functions in a recommendatory capacity. The final decision is taken on the basis of the recommendations of IMC by the Ministry.

It is true that there was a decline in award of highway projects in 2012-13 and 2013-14 and attracting private investment under PPP was difficult. Reasons for the same included inadequate project preparatory activities, land acquisition prior to project award, over-leveraged financials for the highway developers in the country, lack of debt products aligned with revenue stream profile of highway projects, some banks reaching the ceiling as per sectoral exposure norms and aggressive bidding based on unrealistic traffic projections.  However, corrective Steps were taken by MoRTH to address the above which included one to one interaction with contractors/concessionaires and other stakeholders, making amendments in contract document templates and implementing an innovative implementation model under PPP mode i.e. the Hybrid Annuity Model. As a result, award and construction of highway projects picked up, including projects under PPP mode.

CHAUDHARY)(a): A quantity of 4.72 lakh ton non-issuable/damaged foodgrain stocks of various crop years lying with State agencies of Punjab in Covered & Plinth (CAP) storage for the period ending 31st March, 2016, was mainly due to improper upkeep of stocks.Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme was introduced on 28.07.2008 for augmentation of storage capacity to meet the procurement and Public Distribution System (PDS) needs of the States. Initially there was lukewarm response of the scheme. Tenders were floated several times and the efforts were continued unabatedly. Delay was due to poor response of the parties against the tenders and higher rates quoted. Considering the poor response, the period of guaranteed hiring was increased initially from 5 years to 7 years and later on to 10 years. In view of it, maximum capacity of 38.84 lakh ton was awarded in 2011-12 in Punjab which was completed in 2013-14 and 2014-15. The capacity of PEG godowns taken over by FCI was 40.88 lakh ton.

This is the first Options product on agricultural commodity futures allowed for trading in India. SEBI vide circular dated June 13, 2017 issued guidelines with regard to eligibility criteria for selection of underlying commodity futures for launch of option contracts, product design and risk management framework to be adopted for trading in options on commodity futures. Based on the guidelines, NCDEX applied for options on Guar seed 10 MT futures, vide its application dated August 7, 2017 and SEBI has approved the same on September 11, 2017.Contd\u2026.2/--2-(c) & (d):\tOptions are derivatives contracts in which buyer of an options has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying at a pre decided price (exercise price) by paying some premium. At the time of expiry, if the exercise price of option is not perceived as favourable by buyer of an Option, he may choose not to exercise the option contract and thus will lose only the premium amount paid. Farmers/Farmers Producer Organisations (FPOs) may utilise this product by buying a put option, thereby hedging their sell price i.e. fixing sell price of their produce by paying a premium without any downside risk. However, if at time of expiry, the Farmers/FPO perceives that the exercise price of option is lower than the prevailing market prices or, if they perceive that they may not be able to deliver the corresponding quantity of commodity for the exercise of the option contract they had entered into, they may chose not to exercise the option.(e) & (f):\t Currently, SEBI has permitted Options contracts in only one commodity each in the category of agricultural commodity futures (Guar Seed) and in the category of non-agricultural futures (Gold). However, options on additional agricultural commodities are permissible, subject to exchanges applying to SEBI for more such commodities which meets the eligibility criteria prescribed vide SEBI circular dated June 13, 2017.******"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=63398&lsno=16", "qref": "63398", "question_number": "1835", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU1835.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU1835.pdf", "date": "06.03.2018", "ministry": "HOME AFFAIRS", "members": ["Reddy Shri A.P.

The crop varieties developed through conventional plant breeding system have given impetus for sustainable agricultural production in major crops including rice and wheat. The productivity of rice and wheat has increased manifold from 668 kg/ha and 663 kg/ha in 1950-51 to 2404 kg/ha and 3093 kg/ha, respectively in 2015-16. Wheat and rice varieties developed through conventional breeding methods of hybridization and selection have led to productivity gains in India and abroad starting the era of Green Revolution in mid 1960s. National Agricultural Research System (NARS) is entrusted to develop high quality and high yielding varieties suited to different agro-climatic conditions of the country. Since 1969 till January 2018, 4723 improved field crop varieties have been developed which include highest number in rice (1021) followed by wheat (395).  Most of these varieties have been bred through conventional plant breeding.(b)\tYes, some of leading examples where varieties have become popular in a very short span of time due to their high yield potential and better adaptation are as under:\u2022\tWheat flagship variety HD 2967 (2011), has currently occupying about 10 million ha area across the country and unprecedented breeder seed demand has been witnessed which has touched 3600 quintals during 2017-18, highest ever demand of a single variety in the history of Indian agriculture.\u2022\tPusa Basmati 1121 (2008), a landmark variety has become  extremely popular in the foreign market due to its superior grain and cooking quality. Approximate cumulative earning due to export of PB 1121 and its domestic share during 2008 to 2016 has been estimated to be ~US $ 20.80 billion (Rs. 1.5 Lakh Crores).  \u2022\tSugarcane variety Co-238 (2009), which has an average sugar recovery of upto 12% has achieved a coverage of more than 14.75 lakh hectares in UP, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Bihar in a very short span of time. The variety is responsible for production of 21.72 and 0.873 million tons additional sugarcane and sugar, respectively. This led to additional income of ~Rs. 65,505/- million and ~Rs. 27,913/- million to farmers and sugar industries, respectively in UP, Punjab, Haryana and Bihar since 2013-14. Some more widely adopted landmark varieties bred conventionally in wheat and rice are as under:-Wheat: HD 2329, WL 711, UP 2338, WH-147, WH 542, PBW 343, HD 2967, HD 3086 etc.Rice: IR-8, Jaya,  Swarna,  Pusa Basmati 1, Pusa Basmati-1121, Pusa-1509, Swarna Sub 1, Samba Mahsuri, MTU 1010, Pusa-44  etc. Newly released varieties are demonstrated at farmers\u2019 fields through many Govt. sponsored extension schemes viz., Front Line Demonstrations, On farm trials, Tribal sub plan (TSP), Bringing Green Revolution in Eastern India (BGREI), National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) which help in faster popularization of these varieties among the farmers.(c)\tCrops are exposed to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses at different stages, which lead to poor productivity vis-\u00e0-vis low production. There are some traits which are not available in nature in the plant genetic resources or wild relatives of a crop, due to which the improvement through conventional plant breeding is not to the expected level leading to reduced yields. Some of such biotic and abiotic stresses in different crops are insects, diseases, weeds, heat, salinity, frost, water logging etc.  Among the available technologies, GM technology has the potential to introgress resistance through transgenes for a particular biotic/abiotic stress viz., pest and disease resistance, abiotic stresses tolerance and also quality traits in different crops including food grains. Bt cotton is the only transgenic crop approved for cultivation in India subsequent to extensive evaluation and regulatory process. Bt cotton was introduced primarily for bollworm control. All India average yield, which was 189 kg lint per ha in 2001 increased to 504 kg lint/ha in 2015 due to introduction of GM cotton.*******"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=63231&lsno=16", "qref": "63231", "question_number": "1808", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU1808.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU1808.pdf", "date": "06.03.2018", "ministry": "AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE", "members": ["Dubey Shri Nishikant ", "Marutharajaa Shri R.P.", "Pandey Shri Rajesh"], "subject": "Assistance to NGOs in Agriculture", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a)\twhether the Government provides any financial assistance to the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) working in the agriculture sector in different States of the country including Tamil Nadu, State-wise;(b)\tif so, the details of assistance provided to various NGOs in the country including Tamil Nadu during the last two years and the current year State and scheme-wise including Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh;(c)\tthe details of funds allocated to the NGOs working in the Agriculture Sector in the current budget-2017-18;(d)\twhether any of the said NGOs are reported to have been involved in financial irregularities;(e)\tif so, the details thereof and action taken thereon; and(f)\tthe monitoring mechanism put in place in this regard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE(SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a)\tYes, Madam.(b)\tThe details of assistance provided to various NGOs for KVK related activities are given in Annexure-I.

MANDAVIYA)(a):\tNo, Madam. The price notification of National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) is followed by the pharmaceutical companies in general. Notices are issued to the pharmaceutical companies who are violating the notified price and overcharging patients under various provisions of Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 1995 (DPCO, 1995) / Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013) read with Section 7A of Essential Commodities Act, 1955. DPCO, 2013 provides for fixing ceiling prices of essential drugs which are part of National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). NPPA has fixed the ceiling prices of 851 essential formulations under revised schedule of DPCO, 2013 resulting in the reduction of the prices as follows: Statement showing reduction in ceiling prices of scheduled formulations with respect to maximum price under NELM 2015 as on 28.2.2018% reduction with respect to Maximum Price\tNo. of scheduled formulations0<= 5%\t2345<=10%\t13410<=15%\t9815<=20%\t9820<=25%\t9325<=30%\t6530<=35%\t4635<=40%\t24Above 40%\t59Total formulations in NLEM 2015\t851No person is authorised to sell the scheduled formulation at a price exceeding the ceiling price in the DPCO, 2013. (b) & (c):\tNPPA is monitoring the prices of scheduled medicines and takes action against companies found overcharging the consumers based on the references received from the State Drugs Controllers / individuals, samples purchased from the open market and price violation reports from market based data and complaints reported through the grievance redressal websites, \u2018Pharma Jan Samadhan\u2019 and \u2018Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS)\u2019 alongwith the analysis of price data from All Indian Origin Chemists & Distributors Limited - Advanced Working, Action & Correction System (AIOCD-AWACS). NPPA also monitors the maximum retail price of non-scheduled formulations and ensures that the MRP of life saving medicine does not exceed more than ten percent of maximum retail price during preceding twelve months. The fixation of ceiling prices/MRP under DPCO 2013 has resulted in a total estimated saving of Rs. 11,365.61 crores to the public as follows: Particulars\tSaving to consumer ( Rs. in Crores)Under NLEM, 2011 from May,  2015 to Feb, 2016\t2,422.24Under NLEM, 2015 from March, 2016 to till date (28.2.2018)\t2,643.37Coronary Stents in Feb, 2017\t4,450Knee Implants in Aug, 2017\t1,500Para 19 - Cardio and Anti Diabetic in Jul, 2014\t350TOTAL - \tRound off to 11365.61(d):\tThe National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Policy (NPPP), 2012 was notified on 7th December, 2012, with the objective to put in place a regulatory framework for pricing of drugs so as to ensure availability of required medicines \u2013 \u201cessential medicines\u201d at reasonable prices even while providing sufficient opportunity for innovation and competition to support the growth of pharma industry, thereby meeting the goals of employment and shared economic well-being for all.*******"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=63364&lsno=16", "qref": "63364", "question_number": "1723", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU1723.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU1723.pdf", "date": "06.03.2018", "ministry": "HOME AFFAIRS", "members": ["Pala Shri Vincent H"], "subject": "Ratio of Police to Population", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a) the present ratio of police to population in the country and the details thereof, State and UT-wise;(b) whether a considerable gap exists in the number of police to population and if so, the details and the reasons therefor; and(c) the measures taken by the Government to increase police to population ratio in the country?\r\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI HANSRAJ GANGARAM AHIR)(a)& (b): As per data compiled by Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D), as on 1.1.2017, the present ratio of police to population in the country is 151 against sanctioned ratio of 193 for per one lakh population.

However, the more populous states have relatively lower Police population ratio.-2-LS.US.Q.No.1723 FOR 06.03.2018The reason behind the considerable gap in the said ratio exists due to shortage of police personnel.

As part of NEMMP 2020, the Government of India notified FAME India Scheme in March 2015 to promote electric & hybrid vehicles (xEVs) in the country. The Government decided to introduce the scheme as a pilot scheme for 2 years with an outlay of Rs. 795 crore rather than a 6 year scheme with a support of Rs.14,000 crore, as envisaged in the NEMMP 2020.  At present, phase-1 of the FAME India Scheme is underway, which was originally for a period of 2 years from 1st April 2015 to 31st March 2017 and has now been extended for a further period till 31st March 2018.\tFollowing amendments were made in the original FAME Scheme for further promotion of electric mobility \u2013\u2022\tVide Notification S.O. 2696(E) dated 30/09/2015, the scheme for Electric and \tHybrid 2W and 3W of all types was made applicable for their sale anywhere in \tIndia. \u2022\tThe scheme for 3W (Category L5) was further extended for Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) Variant vide Notification S.O. 4175(E) dated 23/12/2016.\u20262/-: 2 :\u2022\tElectric 3W (with maximum speed not exceeding 25 km/hr) has also been included for availing incentive under the scheme Vide Notification S.O. 2199(E) dated 04/07/2017.\u2022\tL5 category has been included in the Retrofitment category vide Notification S.O. 2198(E) dated 12/07/2017.\u2022\tFully Electric Bus has also been included for demand incentive under the Scheme Vide Notification S.O. 3012(E) dated 12/09/2017. \tIn addition to above said amendments, recently the Department had announced the launch of public & shared mobility based on electric powertrain, through a system of Expression of Interest (EoI), offering demand incentives in combinations of electric buses, electric 4-wheeler passenger cars and  electric 3-wheelers  to  million  plus  cities  &  special category states. This EoI has received tremendous response, whereby the Department received 47 proposals from 44 cities across 21 states having requirement of 3144 E-buses, 2430 E-Four Wheeler Taxies and 21545 E-Three Wheeler Autos. After evaluation of these proposals, eleven (11) cities were selected for funding  under  the  \tpresent  Expression  of  Interest  as the pilot project. Selected cities are required to finalize the tendering process and issue supply order before 28th February 2018. Based on the experience gained in the phase-1 of FAME Scheme, \tit has been observed that non-availability of sufficient charging infrastructure and absence of lithium battery technology in the country are \tthe main impediments for smooth roll out, with the expected outcome, of this scheme. Technology in other critical areas such as motors, controllers are also  yet  to  be  fully  developed.  This  adds  to  costs  and makes price of the vehicles uncompetitive.  **********"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=63357&lsno=16", "qref": "63357", "question_number": "1720", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU1720.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU1720.pdf", "date": "06.03.2018", "ministry": "HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS", "members": ["Chauhan Shri Nihal Chand"], "subject": "Swachh Bharat Mission", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "Will the Minister of HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS be pleased to state:(a) the budgetary allocation made by the Government to urban local bodies in the country under the Swachh Bharat Mission during the last two years and the current year;(b) whether the funds allocated have been properly utilized by the local bodies and if not, the names of the bodies which have not utilized the funds allocated to them, State-wise; and(c) whether the Government proposes to allocate more funds to the local bodies for better implementation of Swachh Bharat Mission?        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS(SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a to c):  Under Swachh Bharat Mission \u2013 Urban (SBM-U), funds are released to the State Governments and Union Territories (UTs) on the basis of the proposals received from them.

R. CHAUDHARY) (a) & (b): Madam. The State Government of Bihar has been urged to prepare an export strategy duly identifying the products/services having export potential from the State. The Department has sanctioned financial assistance to support the State Government in preparation of their export strategy. (c)\t: The export of major commodities from Bihar during the last three years and current year (upto December 2017) as per Director General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS) data is annexed.(d)\t:   The measures taken by the Government of India for boosting exports are under the framework of the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), which was introduced in the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-20 on April 1, 2015 with the objective to offset infrastructural inefficiencies and associated costs involved in exporting goods/ products which are produced/ manufactured in India and boost exports of such goods / products. The Scheme incentivizes exporters in terms of Duty Credit Scrips at the rate 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7% of Free on Board (FOB) value of exports realized. These scrips are transferable and can be used to pay certain Central Duties/taxes including customs duties. The Scheme covers exports under 7950 tariff lines at 8 digits level to all countries. The benefits under MEIS are granted based on HS Codes only (except a few items) and the process of grant of MEIS benefits has been simplified recently thereby reducing the transaction cost of the exporter community. At the midterm review of Foreign Trade Policy, the rates for MEIS were enhanced for key labour intensive sectors such as ready-made garments, made-ups, leather items, handloom and handicraft items, sports goods and Agricultural items, carpets etc. Similarly, under Service Exports from India Scheme (SEIS) of the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20, there are rewards on Net foreign exchange earnings, to service providers of notified services who are providing service from India to the rest of the World, in the form of Duty Credit scrips which are transferable and can be used to pay certain Central Duties/taxes including customs duties. In the Mid-term review of the FTP, the rates for all these services have been further increased by 2% with an additional annual incentive of approximately Rs 1,140 Cr.  Government has also launched a new scheme Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) w.e.f. F.Y. 2017-18 with the objective to provide financial assistance for creation of export infrastructure in the states.

Further, as per FSR, macro stress test for credit risk indicates that under the baseline scenario, the GNPA ratio of the banking sector may increase to 10.8 per cent by March 2018.(c) and (d): The problem of NPAs of banks has been addressed holistically through transparent and realistic recognition of NPAs, provision for expected losses and unprecedented recapitalisation, and putting in place a clean recovery system.Asset Quality Review initiated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2015, and subsequent transparent recognition by banks revealed high Non-PerformingAssets (NPAs), which have impacted balance-sheets of several Public Sector Banks (PSBs). For strengthening PSB balance-sheets, under Indradhanush plan, Government provided for  Rs. 70,000 crore till FY 2018-19, as a result of which despite high NPA and consequential provisioning, banks were successful in complying with capital adequacy norms. Further, with the object of increasing credit off-take and promoting creation of jobs, in October 2017 Government announced, and has since initiated, recapitalisation of Public Sector Banks by    Rs. 2,11,000 crore within two financial years to make banks weakened by NPAs strong.Further, to enable effective action in respect of defaulters, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 was enacted, which provides for timebound resolution of stressed assets. Cases have been instituted under the Code in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in respect of the 12 largest defaulters, amounting to about 25% of the NPAs of the entire banking system. To safeguard against misuse of the legal process, wilful defaulters and persons associated with NPA accounts have been barred from participating in the process under way in NCLT.(e): As per RBI\u2019s Master Directions on Frauds, banks undertake forensic audit and take action upon forensic audit reports. These Directions do not envisage submission of such reports to and action thereon by the Government.****"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=62854&lsno=16", "qref": "62854", "question_number": "1346", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU1346.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU1346.pdf", "date": "09.02.2018", "ministry": "FINANCE", "members": ["Mahto Dr. Banshilal"], "subject": "Credit Card Issued by PSBs", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a)\tthe norms adopted by the Public Sector Banks (PSBs) to issue credit cards;(b)\tthe  number of credit cards issued by the PSBs during the last three years and the current year, bank-wise;(c)\tthe amount of loan provided through these credit cards along with the percentage of the loans disbursed out of total loan; and(d)\tthe details of non-performing assets as a result of non-payment of outstanding dues through these credit cards?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        The  Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance (a)\tReserve Bank of India (RBI) circular DBR.No.FSD.BC.18/24.01.009/ 2015-16 dated July 1, 2015 incorporates the norms regarding credit cards issued by public sector banks.

Focus is also on creation of complete open defecation free (ODF) villages, rather than only on construction of individual toilets. This entails triggering the entire village into changing their behavior.\u2022\tThe programme provides flexibility to the States in its implementation. This is essential, given the vast socio-economic-cultural diversity of India, and also from the point of view of promoting innovations. \u2022\tThere is a greater emphasis on capacity building, especially in community approaches to sanitation and programme management. Therefore, various initiatives are being taken to reach out to all the stakeholders. From the Government of India side, the States and select organizations (called Key Resource Centres) are being trained. These in turn are, carrying out trainings at the sub-State level. The key official at the district level/Collector-has been roped in the programme to provide leadership at the district level. They are being exposed to best practices, both through workshops and exposure visits. More than 530 Collectors from across the country have been trained till date. \u2022\tThe programme is being run as a janandolan with cooperation of all sections of the society including NGOs, Corporates, youth etc. The Panchayats are being actively involved.\u2022\tThere is an emphasis on streamlining administrative and financial procedures, both to cut down on time, as well as to increase accountability.\u2022\tInnovations in technology is being promoted at the National and State levels.

The Government has taken a decision to prioritize all Centrally Sponsored Schemes in ODF villages.  Various other development schemes are being converged with the sanitation outcomes.\u2022\tMonitoring and Evaluation has also been strengthened. The online IMIS (Integrated Management Information System) has data up to household level, with provision to capture geo-tagged photographs of toilets.

Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports. The Kosi-Mechi link project is one of the link project proposed under the Himalayan Component of NPP.  This link entirely lies in Nepal territory. The Pre Feasibility Reports (PFR) of this link project was prepared by NWDA in 1997. Taking up preparation of Feasibility Report (FR)/Detailed Project Report (DPR) depends upon agreement with Government of Nepal. This link proposal is envisaged to provide irrigation benefits of about 4.74 lakh ha (2.99 lakh ha in India and 1.75 lakh ha in Nepal),  24 MCM of water for domestic and industrial uses and generation of 3180 MW of hydropower.Further, an intra-State link project for linking Kosi-Mechi rivers was proposed by Government of Bihar for which NWDA prepared the DPR and submitted to Government of Bihar in March, 2014. Kosi-Mechi link project entirely lies in the State of Bihar and is envisaged to start from existing Hanuman Sagar barrage on river Kosi close to Indo-Nepal Border. The existing Kosi Project consists of a barrage across river Kosi near Hanuman Nagar, canal headworks, Western Kosi Main Canal (WKMC) system in Nepal and Eastern Kosi Main Canal (EKMC) system in India. The present proposal is to extend the existing EKMC beyond its tail end at RD 41.30 km to RD 117.50 km upto Mechi River, so that Kosi and Mechi rivers which flow within Bihar after crossing Indo-Nepal border could be linked together. This link project will provide additional irrigation facilities to about 2.11 lakh ha during kharif season in the new command area between rivers Parman and Mechi covering Araria, Purnea, Kishanganj and Katihar districts of Bihar. Total cost of the Project has been estimated as Rs. 4900.00 crore (2015-16 price level) with benefit cost ratio of 2.40.

At present, 385 fee plazas across the country have been enabled with single ETC lane in each direction of fee plaza. Moreover, it has been decided to upgrade the existing ETC infrastructure from single dedicated lane to Hybrid ETC system on all lanes of all existing & upcoming fee plazas. So far, 11,56,079 RFID tags have been issued and the average daily collection through ETC transaction has increased to Rs. 11.05 crore. (d) Yes, Madam. Government has received various representations from time to time to stop the collection of user fee and also suggestions of bringing a one-time tax to replace the existing user fee collection system. However, this is not feasible because the fee for use of National Highways (NH) is not a tax.  At present, roads are being constructed and maintained through Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode and the fund required for construction and subsequent maintenance of road in this mode is collected by charging a user fee from users of National Highways. Also, abolition of user fee will have contractual implications vis-a-vis highways developed & operated on SPV/BOT model which ultimately have a negative impact on the future investment climate in the roads sector.  (e) In a report on the review of toll policy for National Highways dated 20.05.2009, it was observed that tolling in India differs from the practices in other countries in some important aspects. In other countries, the tolled roads are normally access controlled and therefore, toll is charged on the basis of distance travelled by adopting the \u2018closed system\u2019 with fee plaza at every entry and exit of the tolled road. In India, the tolling is generally under the \u2018open system\u2019, whereby fee payable is a fixed amount which is not on the basis of distance actually travelled. In most of the countries, an alternative road (generally toll free) is available and therefore, the road user has the option not to use the tolled road."}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=62575&lsno=16", "qref": "62575", "question_number": "982", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/14/AU982.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/14/AU982.pdf", "date": "08.02.2018", "ministry": "POWER", "members": ["M.

STATEMENT IN REPLY TO STARRED QUESTION NO. 235 (15TH POSITION) ANSWERED ON 03/01/2018 ASKED BY SHRI SUDHEER GUPTA AND KUNWAR HARINABSH SINGH M.Ps. REGARDING COAL RESERVES.  (a): As per the Report of the Working Group on Coal & Lignite for formulation of 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17), the total coal demand projection was assessed at 1373 MT for 2021-22.    (b): As per \u201cThe inventory of Geological Resources of Indian Coal\u201d, as on 01.04.2017 the total estimated quantum of coal reserves in the country is 315.149 billion tonnes. At present rate of exploitation, coal reserves will last for considerable period.   (c): As per available information, theft/pilferage of coal, if any, is carried out stealthily and clandestinely. As such, it is not possible to specify where frequent coal thefts/pilferages take place during transportation. (d): Measures taken to check theft/pilferages inter-alia include: (i) The coal is being transported through identified fixed route where check posts are provided enroute and manned by CISF at many places.  (ii) Global positioning system (GPS) based vehicle tracking system of trucks with geo-fencing has been implemented for coal transportation to prevent pilferage/diversion of coal through trucks. (iii) To prevent coal theft / pilferage in coal loaded trucks on the way, strict vigil is being maintained and also day / night patrolling is being carried out. (iv) In case of coal transferred and coal received involving two Collieries, the quantity is accepted only after weighment (in majority cases) and at the end of the month, Managers/Agents of both the Collieries sign coal transfer statement. (v) All despatches to outside parties is weighed. (vi) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based boom barriers have been installed at weigh bridges to identify illegal trucks carrying coal. Weigh bridges have been connected to COALNET to capture and monitor weight of the coal carrying vehicles to eliminate human intervention.(vii) CCTV camera have been installed at all vulnerable points like entry/exit gate, weigh bridges, sidings etc. to keep a regular watch. (e): Conservation of Coal is an important area. Mines are designed to work the coal seams either through opencast or through underground methods depending on the technical feasibility and economic viability in such a way that conservation of coal is given due importance right from the planning stage and maximum recovery is ensured during the implementation stage. In underground (UG) mines, introduction of new technologies like Longwall method, Shortwall method, Highwall mining and Continuous Miner technology have resulted in increased percentage of extraction.With the improvement in roof support technology with mechanized bolting with resin capsules, it has been possible to maintain wider gallery span and extract seams under bad roof conditions more efficiently resulting in improved conservation of Coal. Sand stowing in underground mines is yet another effective means of coal conservation, which is widely in use for extraction of coal pillars from underground coal seams lying below built-up areas, such as important surface structures, railway lines, rivers, nallahs, etc. which otherwise would have resulted in locking of coal in pillars. Stowing also helps in the extraction of thick seams in several lifts increasing the percentage of extraction.  ****"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=60727&lsno=16", "qref": "60727", "question_number": "234", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AS234.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AS234.pdf", "date": "03.01.2018", "ministry": "RAILWAYS", "members": ["Hari Shri G."], "subject": "Mechanised Cleaning System", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a)\twhether the Railways has decided to use a state-of-the-art mechanized cleaning system at the railway stations;(b)\tif so, the details thereof;(c)\twhether the said system will now be used for comprehensive cleaning of all platforms, circulating areas and footover bridges in the station premises; and(d)\tif so, the details thereof?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COAL(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 234 BY SHRI G. HARI TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 03.01.2018 REGARDING MECHANISED CLEANING SYSTEM (a) to (d) Yes, Madam. One of the initiatives taken to maintain cleanliness standard at station premises is introduction of mechanized cleaning at major stations over Indian Railways. The mechanized cleaning system is used for comprehensive cleaning of all platforms, circulating area, foot over bridges, retiring rooms, waiting rooms etc. in the stations premises where conducive surface like tiles/kota stone is available. The station cleaning activities are carried out through mechanized means by using High pressure water jets, mechanised floor scrubber, vacuum cleaner, flippers, Battery Operated Push/ Ride on Scrubber, High Pressure Jet, Wet & Dry vacuum cleaner etc. along with the requisite manpower. The activity is outsourced to professional agencies to maintain high standard of cleanliness on the Railway station and its premises. In order to have effective waste disposal system, concrete washable aprons on platform tracks with jet cleaning arrangements are provided at important stations where long distance trains stop in the morning hours, to facilitate cleaning of night soil by washing into side drains and its subsequent discharge away from stations. \t******"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=60733&lsno=16", "qref": "60733", "question_number": "233", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AS233.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AS233.pdf", "date": "03.01.2018", "ministry": "DEFENCE", "members": ["Birla Shri Om"], "subject": "Upgradation of Technology of Ordnance Factories", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a) \twhether the Government has taken any significant step for the consolidation of the defence forces after the publication of the CAG Report which pointed towards the ammunition shortage and if so, the details thereof;(b) \tif not, the reasons therefor;(c) \twhether there is a shortage of staff at various ordnance factories in the country, if so, the details thereof and the action taken to resolve the problem;(d) \twhether the Government requires upgradation of technology used in the various ordnance factories to optimise their rate of production as per the needs of the Indian Defence Services; and(e)\tif so, the details thereof along with the steps taken by the Government to upgrade the technology employed in ordnance factories during the last three years and the current year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF DEFENCE                                    (SMT.

To this effect, Government has entered into fresh tie-ups as well as intensified ongoing cooperation with several international partners. The cooperation is envisaged in terms of, inter alia, joint manufacture, co-production and co-development of defence items, including transfer of technology with a special emphasis on the ''Make in India'' initiative. Diplomatic efforts have also focused on supporting the recently introduced Strategic Partnership model that seeks to enhance participation of private Indian firms in defence manufacturing. The model envisages establishment of long-term strategic partnerships with Indian entities through a transparent and competitive process, wherein they would tie up with global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to seek technology transfers to set up domestic industrial ecosystem and infrastructure, integration with global supply chains and assistance in training skilled human resources. India''s membership to the multilateral export control regimes, such as, Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) and Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) is expected to facilitate high technology tie-ups with Indian industry and ease access to high-tech items for India\u2019s defence programmes.With regard to strengthening of partnerships, Government engages with various countries through bilateral, multilateral and plurilateral platforms on issues that advance our interests and promote our viewpoint. In its engagements with partner countries under various plurilateral platforms, Government has discussed exploring practical steps to enhance cooperation on issues of common interest including international security."}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=60739&lsno=16", "qref": "60739", "question_number": "227", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AS227.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AS227.pdf", "date": "03.01.2018", "ministry": "COAL", "members": ["Gawali (Patil) Ms. Bhavana", "Tumane Shri Krupal Balaji"], "subject": "Coal Washeries", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a)\twhether the Government has set up coal washeries in coal regions of the country including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat;(b)\tif so, the details thereof;(c)\t \twhether each of the said washeries is functional at present, if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor;(d)\twhether the Government propose to increase the number of coal washeries in these States; and(e)\tif so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\nMINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COAL ( SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** 7th POSITIONStatement referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question  No. 227  for  03.01.2018(a) to (c): Coal India Limited (CIL) has set up 15 (fifteen) coal washeries in coal regions of the country.

P. CHAUDHARY)(a) to (c): During the Joint Conference of Chief Ministers of States and Chief Justices of the High Courts held at New Delhi in April 2015, reduction of pendency and backlog of cases in courts emerged as an area which required focused attention at the High Court level.  The Chief Justices of the High Courts in the Conference held on 03rd and 04th April 2015 have resolved that each High Court shall establish an Arrears Committee, which would go into the factors responsible for the delays and prepare an action plan to clear the backlog of cases pending for more than five years.  It was further resolved in the Conference of Chief Justices of the High Courts held in April, 2016, that in order to ensure expeditious disposal of cases pertaining to women, marginalized segments, senior citizens and differently-abled, steps be taken to (a) prioritize the disposal of cases falling in these categories within the existing court system; (b) an endeavour be made to revisit the cadre strength of subordinate courts and, where necessary, create additional courts to deal with such cases.  Accordingly, Arrears Committees have been established in High Courts.  The Supreme Court has also constituted an Arrears Committee consisting of two Hon\u2019ble Judges to formulate steps to reduce pendency of cases in High Courts and District Courts.The Government has adopted a co-ordinated approach to assist judiciary for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial systems, which, inter-alia, involves better infrastructure for courts including computerisation, increase in strength of judicial officers / judges, policy and legislative measures in the areas prone to excessive litigation and emphasis on human resource development.It may be mentioned that the Central Government is fully committed to speedy disposal of cases in accordance with Article 21 of the Constitution. It has undertaken many steps towards achieving this objective. One of these steps is, strengthening of judicial infrastructure in districts through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary.  Under this Scheme a total of Rs. 6009 crore has been released since 1993-94, out of which Rs. 2,565 crore (42.66%) has been released since April, 2014. 17,848 Court Halls and 14,085 Residential Accommodations have been made available for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts under this scheme as on 30.11.2017. Out of this 2,429 Court Halls and 4,172 Residential Accommodations were constructed since 2014 to till date. In addition, 3,143 Court Halls and 1,682 Residential Accommodations are under construction. The Central Government has approved continuation of the aforesaid scheme beyond the 12th Five Year Plan period i.e. from 01.04.2017 to 31.03.2020 with an estimated outlay of Rs.3,320 crore.Under the Phase-I of the eCourts Mission Mode Project undertaken by the Central Government from 2010 to 2015, against a total target of computerisation of 14249 courts, the computerisation of 13,672 district and subordinate courts was achieved. This includes the installation of hardware, the LAN and software.  This has enabled the courts to upload the case status and orders online. Status of cases and copies of judgments have also been made available on the websites of the respective District and Subordinate Court Complexes which have been computerised.In the Phase II of the eCourts Mission Mode Project (July, 2015 upto 31 March 2019) an outlay of Rs.1,670 crores has been approved. The facilities of e-services such as cause lists, case status, daily orders, judgments etc. are being provided under the supervision of e-Committee of the Supreme Court and Computer Committees of respective High Courts. A total of 16,089 Courts have been computerised under the eCourts Project till date. Video Conferencing facility has also been opertionalised between 488 court complexes and 342 corresponding prisons during the period 2015-17. Development of National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), developed under this project, provides updated information on civil and criminal cases, including pending cases, pertaining to the computerised district/subordinate courts in the country."}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=60894&lsno=16", "qref": "60894", "question_number": "2755", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AU2755.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AU2755.pdf", "date": "03.01.2018", "ministry": "EXTERNAL AFFAIRS", "members": ["Singh Prof. Sadhu", "Mann Shri Bhagwant"], "subject": "Indian Students Abroad", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "Will the Minister of EXTERNALAFFAIRS be pleased to state:(a) \tthe number of Indian students went abroad and foreign students came in India for study during the last three years and the current year, State-wise including Punjab;(b) \twhether the Government do not have proper and adequate information about various essential documents on account of the number of students leaving the country for studies abroad;(c) \tif so, the details thereof and the reasons therefor;(d) \twhether instances of Indian students who went abroad for studies are being harassed in various foreign countries have come to the notice of the Government; and(e) \tif so, the details thereof and the steps taken by the Government for safety of such students?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD)](a)\tAs per information received from Missions/Posts abroad, an estimated number of Indian students currently studying abroad as on 28 December 2017 is 586183. However, year-wise/state-wise break-up of number of students are not maintained by the Ministry. With regard to year wise number of foreign students who came to India for higher studies, information provided by Bureau of Immigration is given below:Sl.

Information provided by the students with the foreign Missions/Consulates is not shared with the Ministry. There is also no requirement for Indian students going abroad to study in foreign universities to compulsorily register either in India or in Indian Missions/Posts abroad. Besides, in many cases, students travelling on tourist visa to foreign countries enroll themselves in foreign universities and seek change of visa status in those countries. In view of above, information about the exact number of students leaving India to pursue higher studies is not available with the Ministry. To address this gap, Mission/Post has started organising \u201cWelcome Ceremonies\u201d for the newly arrived students in the foreign countries. This has helped to connect the students and assure them of their well being, safety and security in foreign countries. Also under the existing \u201cMADAD\u201d portal, a separate student module has been created which enables Indian students abroad to register themselves and seek assistance when needed.(d)&(e) It has come to the notice of the Ministry that 21 incidents of harassments/attacks on Indian students happened in 10 countries during 2017. Country-wise data is placed at Annexure-I.Missions took up the issues strongly with local police authorities and concerned ministries of the foreign countries to ensure safety and security of Indian students. Advisories were issued and placed on the website of the Indian Missions to alert the Indian students.Indian Missions are in regular contact with foreign governments, universities and educational institutions, Indian student Associations and community organizations, and take all possible measures to provide assistance to Indian students in foreign countries, as and when such issues arise.Ministry and Missions also issue advisories asking students to carry all documentation and undertake due diligence to ensure that the foreign institutions to which they are seeking admission have proper authorization and capacities."}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=60825&lsno=16", "qref": "60825", "question_number": "2754", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AU2754.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AU2754.pdf", "date": "03.01.2018", "ministry": "COMMUNICATIONS", "members": ["Kumar Dr. Arun"], "subject": "Departmental Examination in Department of Posts", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a) \twhether the departmental examination for promotion to the post of assistant manager in Mail Motor Service of Post Office Department has not been conducted since the year 2005; (b) \tif so, the details thereof and the reasons therefor along with the steps taken by the Government in this regard; (c) \twhether 90 percent posts of Assistant Manager are lying vacant due to this and the Mail Assistant Staff of the mail motor service are deprived of the promotion; and (d)\t if so, the time by which the Government is likely to make recruitment to the post of the Assistant Managers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (IC) OF THE MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS & MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RAILWAYS(SHRI MANOJ SINHA)(a) & (b) \tAs per existing Recruitment Rules, there is no provision for conducting departmental examination for promotion to the post of Assistant Manager, Mail Motor Service.(c) & (d)  \tThe posts of Assistant Manager in Mail Motor Service and Inspector of Mail Motor Service were merged in 2005 with a single nomenclature of Assistant Manager, Mail Motor Service.

The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) through R&D support to IIT-Kharagpur has developed the requisite technology on rice fortification with Iron for addressing the incidence of anaemia. This involves production of Iron fortified rice premix through extrusion process using broken rice kernels. This iron fortified rice kernel premix matches with the normal rice kernel in shape and size, and when mixed with normal rice in the ratio of 1:100 provides 50% of recommended daily allowance (RDA) of Iron. This technology can also be used to fortify rice with other micro nutrients, as well. The incremental cost of fortification has been estimated by IIT-Kharagpur to be upto 80 paise per kg. of rice.  b). The steps taken by Government to take forward the rice fortification model to all parts of the country to deal with nutritional deficiency among the women and children are as follows:A Pilot Scale Unit with a capacity of 100 kg/hr/shift has been commissioned at IIT-Kharagpur and the technology is ready for demonstration. Subsequently, the available iron content in the iron fortified rice after employing different methods of cooking was evaluated by National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad and the studies pertaining to iron bioavailability, acceptability, efficacy, impact of storage on iron fortified rice, and cooking losses are being worked out."}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=60590&lsno=16", "qref": "60590", "question_number": "2486", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AU2486.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AU2486.pdf", "date": "02.01.2018", "ministry": "SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT", "members": ["Yellaiah Shri Nandi"], "subject": "Budget for Welfare of SCs", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a) whether recently a law was enacted for the first time in the country exclusively in Andhra Pradesh State Assembly before partition to spend the enitre Annual budget meant for various schemes of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes exclusively for the development plans of these castes; (b) if so, the details thereof; and (c) the number of years for which the unspent amount shall remain exclusively for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes without any diversion to Union Budget or to any other Union Ministry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RAMDAS ATHAWALE)(a) & (b): The Government of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh enacted \u201cThe Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan and Tribal Sub-Plan (Planning, Allocation and Utilisation of Financial Resources) Act, 213\u201d (Act No. 1 of 213) to ensure the accelerated development of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

R. CHAUDHARY) a)\tThe preamble of Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), inter-alia recognizes reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade as one of its objectives.  Resolving trade disputes, arising when any member violates an agreement or a commitment made by it in the WTO, is also one of the core activities of the WTO. b)\tand c): The Eleventh Ministerial Conference of the WTO (\u2018MC11\u2019) was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 10 to 13 December 2017.   A number of issues including a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes and other agriculture issues, domestic regulations in services, disciplines on fisheries subsidies, E-commerce, Investment Facilitation and Micro, Medium and Small Enterprises (MSMEs) etc. came up for discussions in the meeting. However, no consensus could be reached on outcomes on many of the issues. India and other developing countries wanted outcomes on the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes and other agricultural issues, while preserving the special and differential treatment for developing countries. Some of the developed countries, however were not agreeable to the proposed flexibilities to the developing countries.They wished to advance issues concerning e-commerce, MSME, investment facilitation etc. India and some other developing countries were of the view that these new issues do not have negotiating mandate and, therefore cannot be part of any outcome in MC11.(d)to(e): Ministerial decisions that were taken during the MC11 include a Work Programme on disciplines on Fisheries Subsidies with a view to arriving at a decision by the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the WTO, in 2019. It was also decided to continue with the non-negotiating mandate of the existing Work Programme on E-commerce, as proposed by India.  As was done in previous Ministerial Conferences, an existing moratorium on imposing customs duties on electronic transmission was extended for two years along with another moratorium on TRIPS non-violation complaints, which, inter alia, prevents \u2018ever-greening\u2019 of patents in the pharmaceuticals sector, thereby ensuring accessibility and affordability of generic medicines. Ministerial Decisions on new issues like Investment Facilitation, MSMEs, gender and trade, which lacked a mandate or consensus, were not taken forward.In the meeting, India made efforts to obtain a permanent solution to the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes.On the issue of Agricultural Domestic Support,India was of the view that the WTO Agreement on Agriculture provides considerable flexibility to the developed members to provide huge subsidies and further, to concentrate these subsidies on a few products. This asymmetry needs to be addressed as a first step in agricultural reform without, however, shifting the burden of reduction of agricultural subsidies to developing countries. ***"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=60394&lsno=16", "qref": "60394", "question_number": "2268", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AU2268.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AU2268.pdf", "date": "01.01.2018", "ministry": "HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT", "members": ["Ahlawat Smt.

On this basis, the revenue loss due to implementation of GST to the states for month of July to October has beenestimated Rs. 24,500 crore and the same amount has been released to the States as compensation to make up for the loss of revenue on bimonthly basis for month of July-August, 2017 and September-October, 2017 as per details given in Annexure.(b) Compensation cess collected has been adequate to provide compensation to states for loss of revenue arising out of implementation of goods and services tax.(c) Section 18 of the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, provides that Parliament shall by law on the recommendation of the Goods and Service Taxes Council, provide for the compensation to the states for loss of revenue arising on the account of implementation of Goods & Services Tax for a period of five years. (d) On the recommendation of the GST Council, a cess is being levied on specified demerit and luxury goods, like tobacco and tobacco products, pan masala, aerated waters, motor vehicles etc. over and above the peak GST rate of 28%. Since the rate of cess shall be such so as to maintain the pre-GST tax incidence on such goods therefore there may not be much difference in total tax incidence (tax plus cess) on these goods between the pre-GST and post-GST regime.Annexure\tDetails of GST Compensation released to States as on 31.11.2017S.

MANDAVIYA)(a) & (b)   No, Madam. The Union Cabinet has already approved the National Road Safety Policy in 2010. Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has introduced a Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in the House. Lok Sabha has passed the Bill and currently it is before Rajya Sabha for passing. The Bill contains the provision of setting up of National Road Safety Traffic Management Board (NRSTMB) which will work as lead agency for the Government of India.  The Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court has directed all the States to frame State Road Safety Policy and establish lead agency to all States / UTs. As per information available with Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, all the States / UTs except Assam, Nagaland, Tripura, Delhi, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Andaman have notified the Road Safety Policy. (c) \t\tAny road accident or road accident death may have multiple dimensional. Ideally, the factor responsible should be established through objective assessment of the circumstances under which the road accident occurred. Based on the extent data reporting system, drivers fault is single most important factor responsible for road accident (84%) killings, (80.3%) injuries (83.9%) on all roads in the country 2016. (d)\tAs per Section 165(1) of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a State Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, constitute one or more Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals for such area as may be specified in the notification for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of, or bodily injury to, persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles, or damages to any property of the third party so arising, or both. Sub-section (2) of Section 165 empowers the State Government to appoint such number of members as the State Government may think fit to appoint. Sub-section (3) of Section 165 empowers State Government to regulate distribution of business if there are two or more Claims Tribunals for an area.

Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports. The Pre-Feasibility Report of the all 30 links have been prepared and circulated to the concerned State Governments by the NWDA. After survey and investigations, Feasibility Reports of 14 links under Peninsular Component and Feasibility Reports of 2 links and draft Feasibility Reports of 7 links (Indian portion) under Himalayan Component have been completed. The present status of the projects and the names of States concerned and benefited there under due to inter river water transfers are furnished in the Annexure.Four priority links under Peninsular Rivers Component have been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP) Phase \u2013I & II, Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Mahanadi-Godavari link project. The preparation of DPR of a project is taken up only after consent of concerned State Governments. Based on the concurrence of the concerned States, DPRs of KBLP Phase-I & Phase-II, Damanganga-Pinjal link project and Par-Tapi-Narmada link project have been completed. The techno-economic clearance and various statutory clearances of the KBLP Phase-I have been accorded. The techno-economic clearance  of   the   Damanganga-Pinjal   link   project  has  also   been  accorded   subject  to  statutory clearances. The DPR of Par-Tapi-Narmada link project has been submitted for technical appraisal in Central Water Commission. The DPR of the Mahanadi \u2013 Godavari link could not be taken up as the Government of Odisha was not agreeable for Mahanadi \u2013 Godavari link, a mother link of 9 link system viz., Mahanadi \u2013 Godavari \u2013 Krishna \u2013 Pennar \u2013 Palar \u2013 Cauvery \u2013 Vaigai \u2013 Gundar linkage due to large submergence involved in Manibhadra Dam.

The Committee observed that in 2016-17, the MGNREGA notified wage rate in 17 States/UTs are lower than the agricultural wage rate as given at Annexure. MGNREGA wage rates are currently indexed to state-wise Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL) and based on this index, the wage rates are revised in each financial year for all States/UTs.  The Committee recommended using Consumer Price Index-Rural (CPI-R) instead of CPI-AL.(d):\tThe Ministry along with the States/UTs has been making concerted efforts for improving the timely payment of wages. States/ UTs have been advised to generate pay orders in time. This has resulted in considerable improvement in the status of timely generation of pay order and leading to improvement in actual time taken to credit wages in the workers account.\tDuring the current financial Year 2017-18 (as on 18.12.2017), 85.21% (as on 22.12.2017) payment has been generated within 15 days. The delay in payment of wages are due to implementation issues in the States which include inadequate staffing, non-timely recording and reporting of attendance, measurement, data entry, generation of wage list, Fund Transfer Order (FTO), etc.(e): \tState Government of Rajasthan has recently commissioned a study titled \u201cEnd to End Analysis on Delay Payment under MGNREGA\u201d to Rajasthan Grameen Ajeevika Vikas Parishad (RAJEEVIKA). The study covered sample of 10 blocks in Rajasthan and identified various reasons for delay in payments which included vacant staff positions at block and Gram Panchayat level, frequent transfer of BDOs, lack of adequate infrastructure at block level etc.(f):\tEfforts have been made by the Ministry to reduce the delay in payment of wages to the MGNREGA workers viz., timely release of funds, payment through National Electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) for direct payment of wages into workers account, issued guidelines for monitoring of timely payment and payment of delay compensation, enabling appropriate provisions in NREGASoft to monitor timely payment of wages and payment of delay compensation.

As per IS  15906, mercury exists in fluorescent lamps in three states, namely (i) vapor in a lamp; (ii) liquid metal or as an oxygen compound; and (iii) amalgam.(c) & (d) :\tHealth hazards are primarily because of organic mercury. Mercury is capable of inducing a wide range of clinical manifestations including neurodegenerative disorders, reproductive impairments and muscle skeletal abnormalities. From environmental angle, mercury is a pollutant, which remains in the environment and it circulates in air, water, sediments, soil and biota in various forms. Atmospheric mercury can be transported to long distances through microorganisms and can contaminate the food chain. (e) & (f) :\tCFLs are covered under the E-waste (Management) Rules 2016, notified by the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change on 23rd March 2016. The said Rules stipulate that producers have to ensure collection and channelization of e-waste,  which includes CFLs, generated from the \u2018end of life\u2019 of their own products or  \u2018end of life\u2019 products of any other brand as per Extended Producer Responsibility.  The Rules also stipulates that in case of mercury containing lamps such as CFLs, where recyclers are not available, channelization must be done from collection centre to Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF). During the Eleventh Five Year Plan period, Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) had implemented the Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY) under which incandescent lamps were replaced by CFLs. The Programme included in its component steps for safe disposal of fused CFLs. ************"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=59821&lsno=16", "qref": "59821", "question_number": "1697", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AU1697.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AU1697.pdf", "date": "28.12.2017", "ministry": "ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS", "members": ["Pal  Shri Jagdambika"], "subject": "Dilapidated Condition of NH 233", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a) whether National Highway (NH) - 233 is in a dilapidated condition including the road passing by Dumariyaganj district; (b) if so, the details thereof; (c) the present status along with the time by which repairing and development works on the said NH are likely to be completed; and (d) the steps taken by the Government in this regard? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THEMINISTRY OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI MANSUKH L.

SANJAY JAISWAL, Hon''ble Members of Lok Sabha(a) to (e) An article titled \u2018Nations within a nation: variations in epidemiological transition across the states of India, 1990-2016 in the Global Burden of Disease Study\u2019 was published in the Lancet journal in December, 2017. The article reported that five leading risk factors for Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in 2016 are child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. The article also states that though the levels of exposure in India is among the highest in the world, the DALY due to air pollution decreased by 23\u20226% in India from 1990 to 2016. There are no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/disease exclusively due to air pollution.  However, air pollution could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases.  Health effects of air pollution are synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc., of the individuals.Government has formulated National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as a long term time bound national level strategy to tackle increasing air pollution across the country in comprehensive manner. The overall objective is to augment and evolve effective ambient air quality monitoring network across the country besides ensuring comprehensive management plan for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution. The NCAP focuses on collaborative and participatory approach comprising all sources of pollution and coordination between relevant Central Ministries, State Governments, local bodies and other stakeholders. Government has further taken several steps to address air pollution which inter alia, include notification of  Graded Response Action Plan for different levels of air pollution in NCR; notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards; setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality; introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), ethanol blending, launching of National Air Quality index; universalization of BS-IV by 2017; leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards by 1st April, 2020; notification of Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules; banning of burning of biomass; promotion of public transport network; streamlining the issuance of Pollution Under Control Certificate; issuance of directions under Section 18(1)(b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; notification of about 115 emission/effluent norms for 104 different sectors besides 32 General Standards and special measures for critically polluted areas, etc. ********"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=58924&lsno=16", "qref": "58924", "question_number": "85", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AS85.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AS85.pdf", "date": "21.12.2017", "ministry": "NEW AND RENEWABLE ENERGY", "members": ["Swami Maharaj Dr. Sakshi", "Trivedi Shri Dinesh"], "subject": "Solar Energy", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a):\twhether the target of generating 100 GW power through solar energy will be achieved by the Government by 2022 and if so, the steps taken and the achievements made so far in this regard;(b):\tthe demand for fuels of the solar energy sector and the details of the investment attracted by the Government for the purpose so far;(c):\tthe current status of the domestic industry of polysilicon, PV modules, Lithium ion batteries in terms of costs and the measures taken by the Government to incentivise indigenous solar energy capacity building using tax credits or subsidies;(d):\twhether the Government can achieve its targets for generation of solar energy along with ''Make in India'' agenda keeping in view the low cost of inputs in Chinese markets vis-a-vis the cost of indigenous generation of solar energy; and(e):\tif so, the details thereof along with the manner in which the target is likely to be achieved by the Government?\r\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (I/C) (SHRI R.

The trajectory for bidding of rest of solar power capacity has been finalized as under:-Year\tTotal tenders planned(In MW)2017-18\t20,000*2018-19\t30,0002019-20\t30,000* Of this, 3600 MW capacity has already been bid out.The Government have launched various schemes to achieve the target as detailed in the Annexure.(b): No physical input fuel is required for solar power generation through solar photovoltaic systems. Energy is generated from the solar radiation energy which solar photovoltaic (PV) cells convert into electricity. An investment at the rate of Rs. 5 crore/MW (approx.) is required for solar PV plants.  An investment of                    Rs. 83,000 crore (approx.) has been made for the currently installed grid connected solar capacity of 16,676 MW as on 15.12.2017.(c): There is no manufacturing capacity in the country for Polysilicon. The manufacturers have reported that a capacity of 3164 MW and 8398 MW has been installed for solar cells and solar modules respectively in the country. The Lithium-Ion battery technology has been developed by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) also. However, commercial manufacturing capacity for the same has not come up as yet. The Government provides capital subsidy for setting up of manufacturing units for solar cells and modules and the entire value chain under Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS). This apart, in order to encourage local manufacturing, Government have permitted Foreign Direct Investment up to 100% in renewable energy through automatic route. The Domestic Content Requirement (DCR) of solar modules is obligatory under the Rooftop scheme and solar cells & modules under CPSU and Defence Schemes for government sector. In addition, Government have floated an Expression of Interest (EOI) for 20 GW solar manufacturing capacity.  (d): The Government is confident of achieving the target of 100 GW of solar power capacity by the year 2022. Since the country does not have enough manufacturing capacity at present for solar cells and modules to meet full demand, both imported and indigenous solar cells and modules are being utilized for achieving the targets. *****     *****     *****"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=58912&lsno=16", "qref": "58912", "question_number": "84", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AS84.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AS84.pdf", "date": "21.12.2017", "ministry": "DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION", "members": ["Dhurve Smt.

The Master Plan envisages construction of about 1.11 crore artificial recharge structures in urban and rural areas at an estimated cost of Rs. 79178 crore. This comprises around 88 lakh recharge structures/ facilities utilizing rainwater directly from roof top and more than 23 lakh artificial recharge and rainwater harvesting structures for conserving surplus runoff to augment the groundwater resources. It is estimated that annually about 85,565 MCM of surplus run-off can be harnessed to augment the ground water.  State-wise Rural and Urban Artificial Recharge Structures as proposed in Master Plan are given at Annexure \u2013 I.  The Master Plan is available in public domain and has also been circulated to the State Governments for its implementation.       Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and artificial recharge to ground water is primarily States\u2019 responsibility.  State Governments are supposed to take suitable measures in consonance with CGWA guidelines to improve the ground water resources.\tIt is pertinent to mention here that the rise or fall of ground water level depends on several natural and man-made factors. The most important natural factor is rain fall trend of the area. The man-made factors that impact on water level are; pattern of extraction of ground water for different usage and also various supply and demand-side interventions like, artificial recharge / rainwater harvesting, efficient use of water for irrigation etc.\tGround Water Resource Assessment of the country is being periodically carried out jointly by CGWB and State Governments.  The total annual replenishable ground water resource in 2011 was 433 BCM and as per latest assessment (2013), the annual replenishable ground water resource of the country is 447 billion cubic meter (BCM).  \tDuring assessment year 2013, out of 6584 assessment units in the country, 1034 (15.7%) assessment units are categorized as \u201cOver-Exploited\u201d, whereas during assessment year 2011, the respective figures were 6607 and 1071 (16.2%).  State-wise details are given at Annexure \u2013 II.Steps taken by the Central Government to promote rain water harvesting are as follows:\u2022\tThe National Water Policy (2012) formulated by Ministry of Water Resources, RD & GR, inter-alia, advocates conservation, promotion and protection of water and highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through rain water harvesting, direct use of rainfall and other management measures. The National Water Policy (2012) has been forwarded to all State Governments/UTs and concerned Ministries/Departments of Central Government for adoption.\u2022\tCentral Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under \u201cThe Environment (Protection) Act, 1986\u201d for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country.  So far, CGWA has notified 162 areas in the Country for the purpose of regulation of ground water.\u2022\tCGWA has issued advisories to States and UTs to take measures to promote/adopt artificial recharge to ground water/rainwater harvesting.  30 States/UTs have made rainwater harvesting mandatory by enacting laws or by formulating rules & regulations or by including provisions in building bye-laws or through suitable Government Orders.\u2022\tThis Ministry has circulated a Model Bill to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for its regulation and development which includes provision of rain water harvesting.  So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model bill.\u2022\tCGWB has taken up Aquifer Mapping and Management programme (NAQUIM) during XII Plan, under the scheme of Ground Water Management and Regulation. The Aquifer Mapping is aimed to delineate aquifer disposition and their characterization for preparation of aquifer/area specific ground water management plans, with community participation.  \u2022\tThe Ministry of Rural Development in consultation and agreement with the Ministry of Water Resources, RD & GR and the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers\u2019 Welfare has developed an actionable framework for Natural Resources Management (NRM), titled \u201cMission Water Conservation\u201d to ensure gainful utilization of funds.  The Framework strives to ensure synergies in Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Gandhi Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) and Command Area Development & Water Management (CAD&WM), given their common objectives.  Types of common works undertaken under these programmes/schemes are water conservation and management, water harvesting, soil and moisture conservation, groundwater recharge, flood protection, land development, Command Area Development & Watershed Management.\u2022\tDepartment of Land Resources is currently implementing 8214 watershed development projects in 28 States covering an area of about 39.07 million ha. under the Watershed Development Component (WDC) of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) principally for development of rainfed portions of net cultivated area and culturable wastelands. The major activities taken up under the WDC-PMKSY, inter-alia, include ridge area treatment, drainage line afforestation, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, horticulture, and pasture development etc. \u2022\tThe Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation has suggested all States to adopt water conservation measures like roof top rainwater harvesting, erecting sustainability structures for water conservation etc. For creating such sustainability structures, 10 % of National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) funds are provided to the States. ***** ANNEXURE \u2013 I Annexure referred in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Q.No. *83 for reply on 21.12.2017 regarding \u201cArtificial Recharge to Ground Water\u201dState-wise Rural and Urban Artificial Recharge Structures as Proposed in Master PlanS.No.\tState\tRural\tUrban(including habitation)\tTotal\t\tStructure(Number)\tCost(Rs. in crore)\tStructure(Number)\tCost(Rs. in Crore)\tStructure(Number)\tCost(Rs. in crore)1\tAndhra Pradesh\t27696\t1248.55\t423900\t695.24\t451596\t1943.792\tBihar\t2058\t128.81\t100000\t164.00\t102058\t292.813\tChhattisgarh\t87202\t1856.21\t200000\t309.00\t287202\t2165.214\tDelhi\t8\t0.40\t142850\t1097.50\t142858\t1097.905\tGoa\t1393\t83.58\t10000\t16.40\t11393\t99.986\tGujarat\t18775\t769.00\t500000\t725.00\t518775\t1494.007\tHaryana\t44727\t1255.30\t376000\t1675.00\t420727\t2930.308\tHimachal\t102328\t573.47\t50000\t82.00\t152328\t655.479\tJammu & Kashmir\t1688\t168.80\t100000\t145.00\t101688\t313.8010\tJharkhand\t26282\t1733.34\t200000\t290.00\t226282\t2023.34511\tKarnataka\t72985\t1998.66\t700000\t1148.00\t772985\t3146.6612\tKerala\t754427\t5457.72\t315000\t456.75\t1069427\t5914.4713\tMadhya Pradesh\t532724\t10717.61\t600000\t984.00\t1132724\t11701.6014\tMaharashtra\t51157\t7926.34\t1605670\t2765.75\t1656827\t10692.0915\tNER states\t15250\t765.90\t400000\t656.00\t415250\t1421.9016\tOdisha\t5856\t525.00\t300000\t499.50\t305856\t1024.5017\tPunjab\t79924\t2021.47\t375000\t1650.00\t454924\t3671.4718\tRajasthan\t9603\t1566.07\t500000\t820.00\t509603\t2386.0719\tSikkim\t1905\t54.07\t5000\t13.25\t6905\t67.3220\tTamil Nadu\t193574\t9284.63\t0\t0.00\t193574\t9284.6321\tTelangana\t39129\t1454.6\t326100\t534.76\t365229\t1989.3622\tUttar Pradesh\t108945\t7629.28\t1200000\t1968.00\t1308945\t9597.2823\tUttarakhand\t2900\t414.75\t48250\t68.25\t51150\t483.0024\tWest Bengal\t97360\t3450.06\t300000\t522.00\t397360\t3972.0625\tAndaman & Nicobar Island\t1640\t44.02\t1200\t8.00\t2840\t52.0226\tChandigarh\t0\t0.00\t8700\t652.50\t8700\t652.5027\tDadra & Nagar Haveli\t65\t3.37\t1000\t1.50\t1065\t4.8728\tDaman and Diu\t0\t0.00\t4044\t4.44\t4044\t4.4429\tLakshadweep\t0\t0.00\t6100\t30.50\t6100\t30.5030\tPuducherry\t1740\t61.40\t1000\t3.05\t2740\t64.45\tTotal \t2283141\t61192.41\t8799814\t17985.39\t11082955\t79177.80  ANNEXURE -

This will be a guiding document while approving new institutions by AICTE.2. Selection: The students for the technical courses shall be selected based on a standardized examination.3. Induction training: Every student, on admission, shall be put through a mandatory Induction training to reinforce the fundamental concepts and the required language skills required for the technical education. The model curriculum and the periodicity of this induction training will be separately notified by the AICTE.4. Revision of curriculum: Every affiliating Technical University shall constitute subject-wise industry consultation committee (ICC) with the mandate of examining the existing curriculum and for making suitable changes in the curriculum every year. This process shall be completed in the month of December each year for the courses to be offered in the coming Academic year. Each institution, while applying for approval, shall certify completion of this process, which will be mandatory.5. Mandatory internships: Every student in technical institution shall do three internships each spanning 4 to 8 weeks before completion of the under-graduation. The responsibility will be on the institution for helping the students in finding suitable industry or organisation for the internship.6. Industry readiness: All students passing out of the undergraduate courses shall be imparted technical and soft skills required for working in the industry encompassing \u2013 managerial skills, entrepreneurial skills, leadership skills, communication skills, team-working skills and technical skills.7.

Similarly, there should be leadership training to the heads of the institutions once in 2 years. These trainings would also be hosted through the SWAYAM platform.10. Mandatory accreditation: At least half of all the programmes in the technical institutions shall be accredited through the NBA before 2022. Unless there is credible progress each year, the approval of the institutions can be refused. In order to assist the institutions in meeting the mandatory requirements for applying for accreditation, a separate mechanism will be put in place.Further, AICTE is implementing schemes namely National Employment Enhancement Mission (NEEM) and Employability Enhancement Training Program (EETP) to enhance the employability of the students. In addition, AICTE has also partnered with Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Govt of India, Internshala, NETiit and LinkedIn to provide internship opportunities and industry exposure to students for aligning their technical knowhow with industry requirements.(d): No, Madam. There is no provision in AICTE Act, 1987 for closing down of engineering colleges by the Government.

The funds were released in two installments of Rs. 1.25 cr. each during the FY 2000-01 itself. File relating to the sanction of the film is, however, not traceable. The matter of missing file has been reported to the Police.  Pursuant to an RTI application received in December 2012 in the concerned Division of this Ministry, enquiring about the status of the said film, a request was made to the producer in September 2013 about the status of the film.  Shri Vinay Dhumale submitted two scratch copies of the film in December 2013 along with photocopies of Utilization Certificates (UCs) for the sanctioned fund. On watching the said film and based on some inputs from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, financial irregularities in the production of the film were noticed. After detailed examination of the case, the matter was referred to the CBI in July 2015 for investigation. As per report received from the CBI, a charge sheet has since been filed in the Patiala House Court, New Delhi and the Court has also taken cognizance of the case. **********"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=58329&lsno=16", "qref": "58329", "question_number": "273", "question_type": "UNSTARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AU273.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AU273.pdf", "date": "18.12.2017", "ministry": "LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT", "members": ["Singh Prof. Sadhu"], "subject": "Shortage of Manpower", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a)\twhether there is shortage of skilled/ unskilled manpower in the country;(b)\tif so, the details thereof and response of the Government thereto;(c)\twhether this shortage has adversely affected the progress of major infrastructure projects in the country;(d)\tif so, the details thereof along with the projects reportedly affected as a result thereof during each of the last three years and the current year; and(e)\tthe corrective measures taken by the Government in this regard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (e):  A skill gap study has been conducted by National Skill Development Council (NSDC) over 2010-2014, which indicates that there is an additional net incremental requirement of 12.079 crores skilled manpower by 2022 in twenty four key sectors.

HARSH VARDHAN)(a)to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.7 to be answered on Friday, the 15th December, 2017 on \u2018Drying up of Rivers\u2019 by Shri K. Ashok Kumar.(a) to (c) There are two types of rivers in the country \u2013 perennial rivers, in which water remains available throughout the year and non-perennial rivers, which are rain-fed rivers and in which water flows only during the rainfall period.  The flow in the river is a dynamic parameter and depends on many sub-parameters such as rainfall, its distribution and intensity in the catchment, health of catchment area, vegetation and withdrawals/utilization of water.While reports by some experts have expressed concern about reduction in water flow in rivers, the annual average flow data maintained by Central Water Commission (CWC) for last 20 years for major/important rivers in the country does not indicate any significant reduction in water availability.  However, as per CWC, the per capita annual water availability in the country has progressively reduced due to increase in population, urbanization, improved life style of people, etc.(d) Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management to ensure sustainability of water resources are undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of State Governments, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD&GR) provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes. The National Water Policy-2012 has been formulated by MoWR, RD&GR with the objective of preparing a framework for creation of laws, institutions and plan of action for water resources development and management taking into account the existing situation. A National Perspective Plan for Water Resources Development has also been formulated by MoWR, RD&GR for transfer of water from surplus basins to water deficient basins.  Discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents constitute a major source of pollution in rivers.  Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has been supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in abatement of pollution in identified stretches of various rivers under National River Conservation Plan (NRCP). The NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches of 31 rivers (excluding Ganga and its tributaries) in 75 towns spread over 14 States at a sanctioned cost of Rs. 4517.82 crore. So far, Central share of Rs. 2180.97 crore has been released to the State Governments for implementation of various pollution abatement schemes and sewage treatment plant (STP) capacity of 2455.43 mld (million litres per day) has been created under the NRCP.   State Governments, apart from their own budgetary allocation, are also accessing financial assistance for creation of sewerage infrastructure, including sewage treatment plants, in various cities/towns under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) & Smart Cities Mission programmes of Ministry of Urban Development and the \u2018Namami Gange\u2019 programme of MoWR, RD&GR. \u00acTo control discharge of industrial effluents, the Central Pollution Control Board and respective State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees monitor industries with respect to effluents discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. *****"}, {"link": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=57900&lsno=16", "qref": "57900", "question_number": "6", "question_type": "STARRED", "english_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/13/AS6.pdf", "hindi_pdf": "http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/qhindi/13/AS6.pdf", "date": "15.12.2017", "ministry": "FINANCE", "members": ["Azad Shri Kirti (JHA)"], "subject": "Farm Loan Waivers", "meta": {"current_page": 2199, "total_pages": 7905, "page_url": "http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/Qtextsearch.aspx/", "fetched_on": "2019-02-14 23:44:16.009328"}, "text": "(a) the names of the States which have announced farm loan waivers; (b) whether the Union Government has any such proposal, if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor; (c) whether the State Bank of India (SBI) has prepared any research report in the matter; and (d) if so, the details thereof along with the salient features of the report?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        AnswerThe Minister of Finance(a)\tto (d) : A Statement is laid on the Table of the House Statement refer to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. \u2020*6 to be answered on 15.12.2017 regarding Farm Loan Waivers by SHRI KIRTI AZAD.(a): National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has informed that during the years 2016 and 2017 the State Governments of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab have announced their own schemes, inter-alia, of waiver of loan of farmers.(b): There is no proposal under consideration of the Union Government to waive off loans of farmers. However, to reduce the debt burden of farmers, the following major initiatives have been taken:\u2022\tWith a view to ensuring availability of agriculture credit at a reduced interest rate of 7% p.a. to farmers, the Government of India in the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers\u2019 Welfare (DAC&FW) implements an interest subvention scheme for short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh. Under the said scheme, additional subvention of 3% is given to those farmers who repay their short term crop loan in time, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4% p.a. for such farmers.\u2022\tReserve Bank of India has issued  directions for Relief Measures to be provided by respective lending institutions in areas affected by natural calamities which, inter alia, include, restructuring/rescheduling of existing crop loans and term loans, extending fresh loans, relaxed security and margin norms, moratorium, etc. These directions have been so designed that the moment calamity is declared by the concerned District Authorities they are automatically set in motion without any intervention, thus saving precious time. The benchmark for initiating relief measures by banks has also been reduced to 33% crop loss in line with the National Disaster Management Framework.\u2022\tPradhan MantriFasalBimaYojana (PMFBY) provides a comprehensive insurance cover against failure of insured crops due to non-preventable natural risks, thus providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/ damage arising out of unforeseen events; stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming; and encouraging them to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices. For development of agriculture and welfare of farmers of the country, the Government in DAC&FW, is implementing various Central Sector/ Centrally Sponsored Schemes, which include:(i)\tRashtriyaKrishiVikasYojana (RKVY) (ii)\tNational Food Security Mission (NFSM)(iii)\tNational Agriculture Market (e-NAM) (iv)\tNational Mission For Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)(c) & (d): State Bank of India (SBI) has informed that it has published a study report about loan waiver and its impact on State finances in SBI ECOWRAP issue No. 13, FY 18 dated 20.06.2017.

It was found by the Authority that the net premium amount of 11,445 Khadi Weavers was refunded to the Ministry of Textiles by the insurer with penal interest of 10.3% totaling Rs. 1.18 crores. It was observed that the alleged 11,445 members in the scheme were khadi weavers who were included due to classification error as per the Insurer. Since khadi weavers could not be treated as Artisans under this health insurance scheme meant for artisans, the insurer refunded the amount to the Ministry of Textiles.(d): Further IRDAI had carried out a focused inspection in February 2014 under Sec 14(2)(h) of the IRDA Act 1999, which inter-alia covered allegations in the matter of RGSSBY. Based on the observations made during the inspection and after examining the submissions made by the insurer, IRDAI issued a show cause notice on 31st March 2015.

HARSH VARDHAN)(a)  to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 3 due for reply on 15.12.2017 regarding \u2018Air Pollution\u2019 by Shri Bhairon Prasad Mishra and Shri Nagendra Kumar Pradhan, Hon''ble Members of Parliament(a) Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is monitoring ambient air quality in 691 locations covering 303 cities/towns in 29 States and 6 Union Territories across the country under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP). As per the data, the number of cities where monitored values are exceeding National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) during 2016 is 21 for NO2, 195 for PM10 and 31 for PM2.5. The ambient air quality data for 2016 is given in Annexure \u2013 I. As per the available data for Delhi and NCR for last five years (Annexure II and Annexure III), PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations are the major concern for the entire area, however a few violations are observed in NO2 concentrations in Delhi, Meerut and Faridabad. The concentration of SO2 is within the standard limit at all the locations in all the last five years. Various reasons for high air pollution include vehicular pollution, emissions from industries, biomass burning, construction activities and road dust etc.(b)\tVarious studies from institutions such as CPCB and IIT Kanpur has been conducted to identify the reasons for rise in pollution in country including NCR of Delhi in the Month of October- November. The reason for rise in pollution in the Month of October- November is mainly due to adverse meteorological conditions such as low wind speed and low mixing height; and crop burning, which leads to episodic events. (c)\tAs informed by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, over past four years cases of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) have increased but deaths have not registered a consistent increase year on year in the same period. However, there is no separate data on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases. The state/ UT wise cases of ARI as per National Health Profile is at Annexure IV.(d)\t& (e) The Government has taken several steps to address air pollution which inter alia, include notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards; setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality; introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), ethanol blending, launching of National Air Quality index; universalization of BS-IV by 2017; leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards by 1st April, 2020; notification of Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules; banning of burning of biomass; promotion of public transport network; streamlining the issuance of Pollution Under Control Certificate; issuance of directions under Section 18(1)(b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; installation of on-line continuous (24x7) monitoring devices by major industries; collection of Environmental Protection Charge on more than 2000 CC diesel vehicles; notification of Graded Response Action Plan for Delhi and NCR etc. CPCB has been at the forefront of pollution mitigation activities. Air Pollution mitigation activities like employing 40 field inspection teams for pollution hot spots in Delhi NCR, co-ordinating with various agencies for effective response etc are being undertaken by CPCB. Government has provided adequate funds to CPCB for its various activities, including air pollution mitigation efforts. The details of the funds provided by government to CPCB is at Annexure V. State-wise details of funds released to various Monitoring Agencies during last three years and current year for ambient air quality monitoring as operational and maintenance cost under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) is given at Annexure-VI.
